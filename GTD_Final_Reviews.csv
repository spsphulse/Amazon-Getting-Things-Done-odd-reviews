"A lot of people are complaining about how redundant this edition is (I haven't read the past one). While I agree with them, I also encourage you to push through it and put the book down when you feel that get to you.At first I was reading this and thinking ""aw man, this is kinda dry and it's going to take me forever to finish"" but kept going because I really needed some sort of methodology to help me organize my thoughts and how I could find a better balance in life between work and my hobbies / social life.By reading the book slower, the concepts that are repeated will be easier to remember. Also a few pages in I was afraid this book was going to be only for cooperate minded slaves but David Allen throws in a few spiritual gems.

"This book is more profound than Marx's ""Capital"".  My ex-boss, co-founder of 50M+ startup once verbalized his reason to deny employment of otherwise perfect candidate. In short, he meant the following: ""She is not scared"". I personally had more than 1000+ phone interviews during my career and learned it the hard way: if you are not scared for your life each and every day at work, even if you faked the fear at the interview - you'll lose your job very quick.The landscape changed way too quick for everybody during the last about 50-75 years, making us ""knowledge workers"". Capitalists, aristocrats and their kids, though didn't tell it to us, leaving most of the people unaware of the new way(s) they exploit everybody. NOT being scared to lose your job our days is rather exception that won't even get you hired. Ever.I don't want to spoil the book, but consider the following example from my personal experience. I told my boss once: I want to keep working part-time for you, like 20 hours a week instead of 40, and you pay me half my salary. He agreed, doing me a ""favor"". About 6 month later I realized that I still working 80+ hours for him for half the money. There is no way most of us can stop working leaving the office. I wanted to do ""my own projects"" for the other half of the time, but I couldn't. It's plain impossible. I dare you to try it, if you are in denial.The author claims that ""it's possible"" not to be scared. He teaches you how. This is a very quiet revolution, but this mentality is much more dangerous than what Marx, Gandhi, Kennedy, ML King did all together. This book is a revolution manifesto. Surprisingly, the author is still alive and nobody wants to kill him.",Very dangerous mentality,"March 11, 2019",5.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGEBI2LDQMFAQWCCJKGGQDXAZ7YA,Nikita

"I had one of these for 2 years until the shut off valve broke.  I looked everywhere for a replacement, but since it is an odd size, I could not replace it.  I looked to reorder this 25' size, but it was not in stock.  Finally, it returned and I reordered.  I use this in my barn to water in a stall that is near the faucet.  I like that I can easily move it around and store it when I'm not using it.  The brass fittings also seem sturdy.  It is used and kept in the barn, not used outdoors, so I don't know if that would make a difference on how good or long it would hold up.  I have other, longer expandable hoses that I use outdoors in the garden, and they only seem to last one to one and  a half years.

"I read this book about 10 years ago and it had a profound impact on my personal productivity. I reacently realized that my team needed help on the subject so we started reading & reviewing two chapters per week together. Everyone has implemented it in different ways, but productivity, transparency, and I’d say satisfaction has increased drastically. Also, re-reading and re-applying in new ways to my reality today has had the same magnitude of impact for me as it did 10 years ago.I strongly recommend DOING the book as you read rather than reading it purely to understand in theory. I’ve done both and helped others that have done both. In doing, you’ll find there isn’t a perfect system or implementation to figure out before you ‘really’ do it. Rather, you need to do it and continue tweaking for at least a few weeks to find how to apply which principles to your needs, personality, and habits.If you do, you’ll find that you almost always know what you need to, want to, can, and should be doing at any time and place. With that empowerment, you will do much more of it and feel better about both what you accomplish AND what you don’t.",Excellent to read as a team.

It has to grab your attention. David Allens resume, as it pertains to those he has coached through this system, may be impressive, however, I'm far more interested in learning how it will help me.  I'm not interested in how many Fortune 500 execs he helped.  I think the audio version might have been better if it was read by someone else. He simply is not an engaging reader. I have been listening now for 25 minutes and he he still droning on about what the book WILL be about. Do not waste your money, there are to the point YouTube videos on the topic that will save you the irritation I feel at listening to him.","Boring, Not Engaging - Verbal Projectile Vomitting","July 6, 2018",1.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFZK3PCXQAR37F6ACHCCRWYP2YIA,C H

"Somehow the article ""Orgmode for GTD"" popped up. I kept it in my to read list for a while, but then started reading it. A huge light bulb went off, and based on that article I bought the book, to read the actual details from the master himself. If you are like me, give this method a try.Like many I slow had got myself into a situation where I felt overwhelmed, procrastinated too much, and did not as much done as in the past. Inbox full with a 100 emails in various stages, brain frizzing from trying to remember things. And I was already way more organised than others I believe, I had some reasonable filing systems, I already had a TODO list, but GTD turned this from randomness behaviour into a system.Although I have only practiced GTD for a few weeks, I already feel way less overwhelmed, and more productive. My email inbox is empty! I have 256 TODO items, 26 current projects. Still lots to do, but less anxiety.I think what was missing in my system was the difference between an actual to do, and a maybe/someday. That already sorted things very nicely. I improved my filing systems a bit. I implemented a tickler system, and do a weekly (more daily) review.There are two other things the book did: it told me there's always more to do, be relaxed about that. Secondly, by knowing exactly what there is to do, you can do the things you have the current energy for.Thank you David Allen for this book and for this methodology!","Implemented it for only a few weeks, already feeling the difference","March 13, 2018",5.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGYKSR2DRKSZDT7DOKLTHULRWA5Q,Berend de Boer

"There are 3 PROS to Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity:1. It provides you with a system for removing the nagging worries from your mind and attacking them.2. The book is written in a simple, straightforward manner that anyone can understand.3. You can choose to engage with the principles presented in the book at your own level. However, you get the most benefit by going whole hog.The 3 CONS are:1. In addition to the cost of the book, you’ll soon find yourself buying trays, file folders, Post-its, file cabinets, and other organizing materials.2. It’s a bit of a long read and can get repetitive at times.3. Fully implementing the ideas presented in the book will take some effort and time on your part. Allen even admits it may take a couple years for full implementation.Getting Things Done is basically more of a mental health book than a productivity book. It’s about getting all of the projects, ideas, nagging worries, and more out of your head and into a system in which you will review your work regularly and get things done when you have the time and are in the appropriate context. The five steps are essentially:-Capture – Collect what has your attention-Clarify – Process what it means-Organize – Put it where it belongs-Reflect – Review frequently-Engage – Simply doAllen goes into detail about how to complete each step. Once you are fulling into GTD, you will have more peace of mind, more creativity, more productivity, and others will feel they can rely on you.Attached are a few of my favorite passages from the book (and proof that I actually read it!)Overall, I’m really excited about the possibilities this book gives my life and look forward to implementing GTD.

I plan on reading/listening/referring back to this book often, and even purchased a hard copy to keep at my desk. I feel more productive during meetings, and help people focus on ""next actions"". This book has helped me tremendously with my production at work, by instilling even small pieces of its concepts. I can't wait to go back in and retain even more, and instill habits.Speaking of habits, his recommendation of Charles Duhigg's book The Power of Habit, led me to go out and read/listen to that book, and I truly believe it has  changed my life.

"This is an excellent guide. It leads you gently yet firmly to quickly re-orient you to your chosen life or business goals. Think of it ascleaning and fine-tuning your own inner automotive motor, with a re-calibrated carburator, all pistons whistling clean and lubed with racing oil,the top speed governor ripped off, all systems go, and with your own fingers now on the pulse of the machine - knowing where you want to go, just how fast, and exactly which way, no matter what curveballs life throws at you. You be balanced, my friend. You ride the waves.David Allen's revised edition is very very carefully written. Every line feels like it has been trialed, tested and proven before a loved and cherishedaudience, with follow-up. This is a real meaty book, folks. It is David Allen welcoming you into his home, his honest, frank 30-40 yearsof consulting wisdom: the hardest hard truths of what works where and how. Buy the book.

"I can't believe it. I've heard about this book for years. I've read summaries of the GTD methods and even incorporated them a decade ago in my email inbox. So why bother reading the book?BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH MORE!!!!I picked up a cheap used copy and started flipping. Then I started reading. Then I grabbed a notepad and spent two days reading a chapter, practicing, making adjustments to the system, and then reading the next page.Like many things, it's a whole system that really only works when all the pieces come together. The summaries I've read before have emphasized the Inbox concept and some of the categories. But Chapter 3 was on projects and I'd never heard any of that! That chapter alone was life changing. I've been stuck on one project - well actually it was more like 10 projects! And 5 minutes of following his 5 project steps got me organized and moving forward.I will say - I read an older copy of this book and it is CLEARLY not intended for the modern computer age. So it took awhile to figure out how I wanted to adapt it. Seriously, a whole page for every single thought that enters your head? How about stickies? or notecards? And no, I definitely will NOT need 4 file drawers on hand... but I do need to figure out where and how I want to store information online.I worked through it slowly. I don't want a totally digital solution, because I've found I don't check them regularly (Todoist, Asana, Omnifocus, etc). I've played with bullet journals and love the paper-based system, but found the tasks too disorganized. So, I'm currently doing a bullet journal / digital hybrid.Amazing concepts and I finally see why this is such a classic. I do think the system needs to be adapted for how technology invades our lives - I don't need a special file just for take out menus (that's what the internet is for!). I read there was an updated version, but very, very glad I didn't get it after reading the reviews.My advice: I don't care how much you think you know about his system. Unless you've hired a personal consultant... Read it! And take the time to practice / adapt each thing as it's explained. Because it is dated and you will need to figure out how to adapt it.",There's more to GTD than you think....,"December 14, 2017",5.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEYVW4UPSXJZ24WDHGRTFNJLVW2Q,J. Wilson

"Good framework, with outdated implemetationWhen reading this edition, I had to do a lot of conversation from paper-based examples to digital equivalents. I started going all digital in the mid-1990's with a clunky laptop and 3.5 floppy disks. I was really shocked that people still used paper in 2010, 15 years after I stopped.However, the principles are sound. You have to build a system that you can trust, or your brain will resume it's tasks of tracking and reviewing things in an in-effecient manner.I'm listening to the audiobook version of this now and decided to pick up the 2015 eBook version since it's easier to bookmark and go back to sections that need to be re-read.Finally , I recommend the ritual of reading this book once a year to keep the system fresh in your mind.

"It was clear from very early in the book that the methods described are designed for a particular kind of person. If you are an obsessive compulsive list maker who finds that you are not able to well organize your thoughts in list form, this is precisely the book for you. On the other hand, if you are able to juggle lots of priorities, leaving many unfinished, and don't find that stressful in any way, this book will only serve to make you feel guilty that your method of organization is not up to the OCD standards of the author.In the new introduction, the author even admits that this book is not targeted at people who have not built up the sort of habits that OCD list makers have. He instead refers to ""The Power of Habit"" as a guidebook on how to develop the behaviors required to make GTD a successful process.The book suffers from an excessive amount of ""business patter"", which amounts to filler aimed at bolstering his methods and selling himself as a guru. If you're looking for the core message with a less cumbersome presentation, you might instead consider ""59 Seconds"" by Richard Wiseman.",OCD listmaking for stressed out managers,"October 10, 2017",2.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHWXD75VIHBB2YXYZLUZNQRFFQ4Q,drewster

"Months before purchasing this book, I read an article that discussed GTD and got interested interested in implementing some core ideas I gleaned from that abbreviated reading into my work flow. I didn't think there was that much more to it.... but then I took the time to read this book and I am glad I did.Many of the core ideas of GTD are very simple, but an understanding of WHY those ideas have stood the test of time as opposed to other approaches isn't immediate obvious. With breadth, depth, and optimism (and in a concise, well-articulated, non-condescending manner), David Allen walks you through implementing a system to get complexity out of your head and onto an external/extended mind.From this book, I was expecting mainly productivity tactics or ""hacks"", but instead I got a very comprehensive treatment of not just ""getting things done"", but how dealing with ""low-level"" or ""trivial"" things in our lives is essential for freeing ourselves to engage bigger issues. This book is not just a very practical volume, it is a work of philosophy in the sense that it explicitly states a path of living.",but then I took the time to read this book and I am glad I did,"October 7, 2017",5.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AETYA5TTWHG3YJRIXMMG7J2BWYCA,Alan W

"David Allen has a great balance of practical advice and profound high-level thought. He has a surprisingly powerful vocabulary for the essential elements of any challenging project, and he has specific advice for how to reduce the effort required for those projects so that we can be more creative at them, do more of them across all our interests, or finish those projects more elegantly. I think one of David Allen's most accurate recommendations is to read his book again in several months, because I still think there is more information in it that will resonate more meaningfully once I've gotten experience being on top of everything.

I take 75 mg in the morning from one source and 75mm at night from the other. In about a month, after my system gets used to AHCC, I will double the dose. My general doctor has agreed with my request for another scan in 3 to 6 months. I am 88 1/2 years old and am willing to experiment with immuno building products. I gave this product a 5 star rating because of the speed of delivery the packaging and the fact that after about 2 weeks of use, I notice a change in overall well being.

"I have read a number of books about time management.  The most significant one I have read until this one is the classic by Julie Morgenstern; however, it is principally a look at over arching principles regarding time management.  As I face a completely new and demanding challenge in my professional career, I decided to take a two week period and research time management skills and principles by the authors who books are the best sellers in the field.  In fact, I am going to read five, this was the first.  However, a little complex, David Allen gives great practical systematic ideas.  I have always possessed good time management skills BUT have always had problems facing projects that need to be broken down into smaller steps.  His book is much much richer than what I am saying here, but it is worth the read, trust me!  The best I have read ever thus far.",Not just principles or a philosophy or ideas around time management but concrete goals!,"June 27, 2017",5.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFAVOEMRYWAT6DLXTJUMRHKFEEIQ,SpiritualityProf

"First I'll say that I bought this book as an audiobook to listen to while I drove back and forth to work.  I do like the concept behind GTD but the delivery is painful.  You quickly get the impression his pay was directly tied to the number of words he pulled out of a thesaurus.  I mean seriously, how many times does a person repeatedly use the words ubiquitous or paradoxical in their day to day conversations?  I could follow what he was saying. It's not that I'm too stupid to understand the words he was using.  It just made listening to the book as enjoyable as reading a 352 page legal contract.

"Getting Things Done is definitely a lot to dig into. Upon first getting into it, seem pretty overwhelming. However, after using this system to some degree (sometimes implementing a lot of the tactics, sometimes not as many), I've come to realize that the approach to this book and resource should be framed as an ongoing study and periodically re-visiting the material.I've had more success with the GTD tactics recently, when I approached the book from the mindset of consistently and regularly studying the material, and having regular check-ins to tweak how I implement the tactics.In short, I believe Getting Things Done is most useful and effective when approaching this framework as an ongoing study and practice, rather than a ""read it once"" approach.Getting Things Done can be tedious, but the key to it's effectiveness is in your mindset and approach - treat this book as reference material to regularly consult in your ongoing practice of daily professional and personal productivity.",GTD is an ongoing practice...,"April 26, 2017",5.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF2BP4XUG2IEAYKTI3ZYAMFCRBQQ,Jon

"I think the strategy posed in this book is good, but — to echo other reviews — the book is quite repetitive. I feel like that's a real and important disservice to all the super stressed and busy people who would pick it up. They don't have time to read about how to create a filing system THREE different times.Here is a cheat sheet to the book:- Skip Chapter 1--every word- In chapter 2 flip through until you see the diagram. It's helpful and sums up the entire process. You can read the beginning of the chapter if you want to get an overview of the process.- Chapter 3 is about how to plan and organize large, complex projects. It's helpful but repetitive. I'd only read the beginning if you don't know much about what he calls ""vertical thinking.""-Only read chapter 4 if you intend on keeping a filing system for all your reference material. Otherwise, just pick a way to capture your lists (pen and paper, computer, app) and know that he recommends taking two full days (at least) to implement his system.-Chapters 5 through 9 describe the system in detail. This is what you need to read, though each chapter is also repetitive and over explanatory. But I would go through these pretty much in their entirety. You don't always need to read when he explains what he means. (He explains what a list of ""Calls"" would have on it, for instance. And he says more than, ""list of people you need to call."")-Chapter 10 I thought was totally useless.-I haven't read part 3. It looks like deeper thoughts and conclusions, but I'm kind of over this book at this point. A quick skim tells me you don't need it.",Too much explanation and repetition slows down what should be a quick read,"April 14, 2017",3.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHT5ZGGQU2FLJJAMYJD5ZAW55ZCA,Earlybird31

"I was very interested in this book because I'm in one of those jobs where my priorities can change with every new email, while also juggling a busy personal life. When I read in the introduction this was exactly the sort of situation the book addresses I was glad to dive right in. Unfortunately, reading the book takes forever. The author repeats himself over and over and continuously promises to get to the actual ""getting things done"" part later in the book. For a book that is supposed to help you be more efficient, it's really not.I rarely leave book reviews, but made an exception here. This book could have been half the size and been helpful for busy professionals. As it is, I assume the author got paid by the word and didn't care he was wasting his readers' time.","If you have time to kill, this is worth it.","March 16, 2017",3.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AED5CW3HKO2URSRTAA77RUORET7A,Kristyle Solomon

"This book offers some great organizational advice, but the method proposed seems too complex to be practical. Instead of offering strategies for identifying important information, Allen suggests filing anything you even think you might want someday, which (as he even admits) would lead to many file cabinets full of papers. Some gems in the book included the idea of a single inbox that you empty every day, the 2 minute rule (when processing your inbox, do all the things that require 2 min or less, and then tackle the longer items), and a single Projects list (a list of everything you want to get done this year).

"Indeed, this is a book about making a difference. As a Master Trainer for the UN Entrepreneurship Capacity Building Program, I used David Allen's concept of planning to help thousands of business people.This book goes beyond the act of simply reading a book. The author suggests to the reader to take something he plans to do and define why he is doing such thing. Then the next natural step is to pinpoint what success, in this case, means to him. Now, it's time to bridge the gap between the here and now and the ideal future state by listing all the potentially good ideas that can be implemented. However, what I like about the book is that at this stage, the author gets you to take action. He simply asks the reader one question, namely, what is the next action? As soon as you jot the idea down, you start making progress and stop making excuses.If you want to learn how to set your priorities straight and deliver your solutions on time again and again, this book is for you.",This book is about making things happen,"February 19, 2017",5.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGXRXKQGZ4J2WMLRQRDT6BES5L4A,Adao Silva

"Mr. Allen’s system is incredibly simple. But it is also powerful and takes discipline. He makes a very persuasive argument for his technique, which pared down to its absolute essentials is: “WRITE EVERYTHING DOWN AND DATE THE NOTES!!!” Which, did I mention, takes discipline? And practice. What makes Mr. Allen’s command unique is his process for taking that piece of copier paper, torn-out journal page, restaurant napkin or whatever other “container” came to hand and making sure it doesn’t get lost, literally or figuratively. And that’s also where the discipline comes in. And practice, practice, practice. Did I mention it isn’t easy at first? Don’t just start writing things down and hoping for the best. Especially if you like to write things down anyway, read this book, more than once if you need to, and slowly and carefully start building Mr. Allen’s advice into your already-begun habits. If you don’t like to write things down, Mr. Allen might change your mind.Lauren Williams, Certified Professional Organizer(R), Owner, Casual Uncluttering LLC, Woodinville, WA USA",WRITE EVERYTHING DOWN AND DATE THE NOTES!!!!!,"February 14, 2017",5.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH5SBYATYMC3L7BXRIH6U52MPSOQ,"Lauren Williams, the Casual Unclutterer"

"Self help is not a genre of books I read very often, but I made an exception for David Allen’s Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity. One of my goals for 2017 was to become better organised and to be more productive. I first learned about the GTD methodology through Carl Pullein’s YouTube channel that I follow. I’ve been working on this for around six weeks now, so it’s too early to tell, but I’m happy with what I’ve learned so far.Getting Things Done, or GTD, is a productivity methodology based on a few deceptively simple concepts. Now, I’m still very new to GTD, but this is how I see it.  One of the fundamental ideas behind GTD is that the human brain is excellent at processing ideas and being creative, but not a great storage facility.  A key part of GTD is getting all ideas, projects and commitments out of your brain and into a trusted system or external brain.There are five activities to GDT: Capture, Clarify, Organise, Reflect and Engage. If I can take from the GTD website, this translates to:Capture: Collect what has your attention.  For me, this means adding all my ideas, commitments and to-dos in my list manager application of choice, Todoist.  I really love this application and regret that I don’t have it at work. I try to capture everything from my doctor’s appointments, to buying cat food for Lushka to a reminder to ask my husband if we have picture hooks.  I’m planning a trip to Europe this summer, so any time I think of something like oh, I must remember to get Swiss francs, into Todoist it goes.Clarify: Process what it means.  Here I can’t be any more concise than or as clear as the workflow diagram on the GTD website:GtdHonestly, if I take away nothing more from my experience with GTD than the two minute rule (if you can do it in two minutes, do it now, otherwise delegate it or defer it) and the discipline to define the next physical action to move a task along it will have been worth it.Organise: Put it where it belongs.  This is probably the area of GTD that’s least intuitive for me – I’m not very organised!  At the very least, I try to put any appointments on my calendar, any tasks in the appropriate section of Todoist, and potentially relevant non-actionable information in Evernote.  One interesting aspect of GTD is the use of contexts.  This means organising your tasks not by priority but by the tools, location, and/or person you need to be able to complete them successfully.  So, for example, in my Taxes 2016 list I have an item; pick up tax receipt from pharmacy.  I tagged that as “pharmacy” along with other items like pick up Polysporin and drop off new prescription.  So when I go to the pharmacy I just check that tag to be reminded of all the things I have to accomplish while I’m there.  Similarly, while planning my trip to Europe I have a context of Susanne, the friend I’m visiting.  Any time I think of something I need to ask her, I add it to that list of things to discuss next time I call or email her.Reflect: Review your to do list and calendar frequently.  The idea here is to keep your “external brain” current with everything that you need to accomplish.  If you don’t add to it or clear our stale items, your real brain will no longer trust your system and it will break down.  Most GTDers do a review at least once a week.Engage: Simply do.  Pick the tasks that are available to you based on your contexts and get cracking!The book itself is very well written and the edition I have was updated in 2015 to include discussion of new technology (not specific applications) and how it impacts the GTD workflow.if you are interested in improving your productivity and generally getting things done you could do a whole lot worse than to check out this book.I gave Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress Free productivity five stars out of five.",This is the go-to book for the GTD methodology,"February 4, 2017",5.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AE7F3E6HVPVMCNXO6RYNFYRV3DWQ,Canadian eReader

Meditation does the rest.If this book has any weakness, it's that it's bottom-up approach could make you feel like you're reacting to life instead of guiding it.

"I have mixed feelings on this book.  I feel that over the years I've organically developed a very similar system as what David describes in his book.  That said, the mere fact that David goes in to detail describing his system adds clarity and refinements to my existing system.  Some of the things I did, I did not not even realize I did until they are mentioned in the first part of the book.However, the implementation section of the book is wayyy too long, and honestly could be half as long or maybe even a few short pages. Hearing about all the executive offices David has been in and how to use things like post it notes and notebooks make it hard for me to take his actual implementation of his strategy serious.",Mixed feelings,"January 8, 2017",3.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFZRU7X34ZWPTHVCH3ZCV5H5KUJQ,That Guy

"As many have reviewed this book after reading the first version, I do not fall into that category.The 2015 update is my first time reading David Allen's theory of GTD, and it is a great system.I ended up ordering an addition copy in Kindle format because this is an extra cheap trade paperback printing from Penguin, the paper is too thin to highlight or make note on without impacting the reverse side of the paper.The quality and usefulness of the content is a clear 5 star book by David Allen.The quality and presentation by the publisher Penguin Books 2 stars.

"This book could be a wonderful resource for some people, but it was not useful for me.  I did find some very interesting and probably useful ideas early in the book, but i soon become frustrated with repetition and use of 200 words to explain a point that could be made in 25 or 50 words.  I think it is very likely there are some other ideas later in the book that would have been beneficial to me, but I gave up trying to slog through the long text to find them.  My recommendation would be to use caution before choosing this one - if you happen to be someone (like me) who wants to get the the point fast and finds the fun part of leaning in the new concepts and ideas part.  If you are more interested in a lot of detail and precise recommendations for dealing with many different aspects of organizing work and life, this may be the perfect book for you.",This book could be a wonderful resource for some people,"January 7, 2017",2.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF2PP5BSXQLL6BEI6C26VVNWTMJQ,Rick

"This is the most down to Earth, practical, and verifiably useful ""self-help"" book I have ever read. The title may imply that this is a blueprint for chronic busy-bodies, but what is at the core of the author's teaching is actually about removing road blocks in order to have more open time for creativity and spontenaity. You aren't going to get a bunch of mystical and esoteric abstractions with this book. What you will get are concrete and testable actions that will help you get a handle on all of the things you want and need to do. This isn't just a book for business professionals or executives; literally anyone can apply these principles to their daily lives and see an improvement.This is one of those books that you will want to read some of, go apply the principles, and come back to for more. It really is a very actionable experience. Because this book deals with all of those things floating around in your own mind to get done, you don't have to wait for some opportunity to arise in order to start applying the methodology. You can start reading this book and immediately start taking action. I think that is why this book has seen such broad success; it can be instantly applied and discerned.",Practical And Verifiably Useful,"January 4, 2017",5.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF3Q5BYB7BMSZSHQAKRWAWTUERZQ,Amazon Customer

"This book cost me one year of my life. It was one year when I was on top of all the meaningless day to day things, but didn't make anything important. The main concepts of the book are simply wrong. You just make open to do lists with things to do in different contexts, i.e, locations. You get very good in doing thing locally related, but don't do the important things you should be doing. As the system encorages you to make the decisions of what you must do in an ongoing basis during the day, and you are more and more exhausted as the hours go by, you are inclined to do the easier things, always putting aside the most chalenging ones, those that could help you advance in your life or work. As the time pass, you don't even try to put essential things in your lists anymore, trying to avoid the frustration of never crossing them out. Other problem is that the system works with open to do lists, with new tasks being added as the old ones are being done, making an endless loop that, after a while, make you feel discouraged, because you never get to the botton of it, you never have a sense of closure, with is important for feeling good about yourself and keep going. Your lists keep getting bigger and the feeling of overload that time management was supposed to eliminate gradually returns. If you just want to have your house always clean, your car revised, the day to day things of your work done, buy this book. If you want to do something more meaningful with your time, don't.

"I listened to the audio version of this book. The first 4 or so CDs are primarily the author extolling the virtues of his method. He actually uses the word elegant repeatedly to describe his method. The final CD is more aggrandizement of the method, further inflating the author's huge ego.

"It's a quick read.  Speed read it, and you will find it repeats enough to let it mostly sink in.  It's a few simple yet powerful ideas that seem like they can change your whole life.  I'm anxious to see how this works.  It reminds me of what a psychologist once spoke of:  cognitive distortion.  Be honest with yourself.  Avoid saying things like ""that's the best in the world"", ""I've never seen anything like that"", ""you have the worst send of humor"".  All of those have a distortion.  Avoid distortions, and you will feel better because there is uneasiness with lies.  There is this feeling, ""what does he really mean?""  So, by using GTD, you avoid a different kind of uneasiness.  This is caused by thoughts that keep coming around because you don't act in them.  This system sets that process in motion.  You will see you feel better just getting those thoughts on paper.  I need to see how the rest goes, but I'm pretty sure I'll be able to hone this skill to a fine art.  If I were to read this book for the first time, I would find that flowchart somewhere in the book and really focus on that.  Then it will sink in better as you see it discussed in print.

"The hardest thing about this book is ""Getting it Done"" I purchased the hard version instead of the kindle to be able to offer it to others to read if I found it to be extremely helpful in getting organized. I think this book became a best seller because most people buying the book had the same thought in mind in reading the title to make their lives stress free in getting things done!  But the hardest part about this book was getting down to the nitty gritty of what it had to offer. The first several pages are so boring and slow to get to the point. We already know we can become disorganized so the author did not need to waste time filling the pages to tell us why instead of offering solutions. But because I purchased the hard copy, I saved time and found it easy to skim through and find some helpful advice scattered among the many pages.  If you are like me, you make lists and cross off what you complete and accomplish. This works for me but the author does offer better methods in accomplishing work that doesn't overwhelm or force you to make such lists in the first place. The five steps, capture, clarify organize reflect and engage to master the workflow is a great solution, steps not taken individually but taken working together to move forward. A lot of what the author recommends is common sense in which most people already know but either procrastinate or become lazy in applying. With that said, and if you are like me, there are pages and pages in this book where you will easily recognize yourself. But also, if you are like me, you will also recognize some good advice to follow on some pages that will be worthwhile and save you time, such as good planning methods and reducing paperwork. For instance, one solution is to gather all the necessary resources that you need to accomplish something successfully.This may seem like common sense.Yet, you would be surprised to find how many people are not self starters or know where to begin a project without knowing they need to find and refine their resources for success. If you are busy and somewhat organized and able to get most things that you need to accomplish, you should not waste your money or time on this book. You will probably keep putting this book down and regret it is too boring and time consuming to get through.  If you are disorganized, don't expect this book to cure you of disorganization or drastically change your life but use it for some valuable lessons you may find in ""getting things done'  Mrs Goodbuys gives this book a two star rating because the book is too complicated to read or become engrossed and did not really offer a stress free life in ""getting things done"" as the title entices.",Don't Waste Time or Money in Getting Done this Book!,"October 12, 2016",2.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGBICZJMPBIK44BU5GLJIP324WJQ,Mrs. Goodbuys
"Quite possibly the best self-help book I have ever read. This updated version takes us well in to the twenty-first century and the new ways we communicate, consume information and organise ourselves. David Allen allows us complete flexibility with how we set up the GTD method, it really doesn't't matter whether you prefer pen and paper, digital or some hybrid method of your own choosing. Once you truly get GTD, it is a life changing experience and one you will never go back on. I think that is why this book has endued so long and why is it still so applicable today when stuff is coming at us from all angles.Thank you, David Allen for this.

"It's a self help book, I guess, but it feels more like a business book. Mostly, it's about organizing the stuff in your life so that you are more in control of it, and accomplish more.I've gotten some benefit from it already, enough so that I bought my own copy for review (this was a borrowed book). The simplest piece of advice it gives - and one that has been amazingly useful to me - is the ""two minute rule."" It's obvious enough in retrospective: when handling a new task/piece of input/whatever, if it will take you less than two minutes to do, just do it.The basic concept of <b>Getting Things Done</b> is to get things (tasks, ideas, projects, etc.) out of your head and into some sort of ""external brain,"" be it a set of paper lists, an electronic filing system, or whatever. Divide them into tasks (actual physical actions), projects (anything that takes more than one physical action), and someday/maybe things. Then for the projects, decide what the next action is - that's a real physical action - and put it on a next-actions list.The idea behind this is that your brain is better at thinking about things than at remembering them (other than rote memorization). Things that you know you have to deal with cause stress and anxiety, but if you put them where you know you won't forget them, you can forget _about_ them until you actually deal with them - you won't have the nagging feeling of guilt that you haven't dealt with ""that"" yet if you have a physical plan for dealing with it.It takes a fair amount of implementing, and I certainly haven't done it yet, but I'm going to give it a try.",Seems pretty useful though I haven't gotten far with the implementation yet,"October 1, 2016",4.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGNSE57QKPNWN72DB5MZVRD4XRXQ,Dan'l Danehy-Oakes

"I've read the 2002 edition and found it to be extremely helpful. This version is atrocious. Ok, the core thing is the same, but it is filled with so much puffery and extraneous words, it is actually the opposite of the spirit of Getting Things Done, which is to get to the heart of the matter.This new/revised edition clicks in at 352 pages up from the 288 pages in 2002. Seventy extra pages for what? The system didn't change, only some examples and the endless pedantic puffery. Allen was already a blowhard in 2002 (he is a management consultant, so he gets paid to have a strong presence. Curiosity made me do a count from both books (ebook versions) of the phrase ""I "". A whopping 1,736 of these are found in the new edition, while an already large number 942 was in the earlier edition. That's up from an average of 3.3 to 4.9, a 50% inflation of puffery.I feel sorry for those who would pick up this edition first, as it is really very difficult to wade through the endless wasted words especially in the first few chapters. Someone needs to make an updated version that is much, much more concise and actually follows the spirit of Getting Things Done. Peter Drucker was always the best for that and in reality, David Allen merely copied his ideas and gave concrete form in terms of organizing the paper trail. Read Drucker's ""The Effective Executive"" and you will learn a lot more. Then read the 2002 edition of Getting Things Done. Skip this new version, it is just too painful to read.","Horrible revised edition, desperately in need of an editor","September 21, 2016",2.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGYUULLNMBUD4PZ4RVCPRF55LQTQ,Amzn Shopper

"Good ideas here, but the overall system he recommends is a bit cumbersome and may not be for everyone. I liked some of the ideas set forth in this book, similar to many other books on productivity, he stresses identifying ""areas of responsibility"" (others may call them realms, Covey called them 'roles') such as personal fitness, finance, career development, etc - and using that to guide the daily and weekly things that we do.  He also explains why planners and to-do lists in their most basic form don't work for capturing the complexity and detail of all of the things that 21st-century professionals do.  This part hit home the most - as a physician there are both urgent tasks (refilling a script, making a phone call, finishing a progress note) and important tasks (reading the latest NEJM article that pertains to your field, working on research, attending a conference in your specialty, networking in some cases: basically all the things that allow us to sit back, analyze our strengths/weaknesses, and learn). You might never get to the important things unless the urgent things are handled when they come up.Allen proposes a complex system in which you analyze all your 'inputs', process them into different categories, and also outline all your projects and identify the crucial next steps to putting them in motion.  I think that this works for many things - i.e., research, developing a fitness plan but is not something I'd necessarily do for a 'small project' (i.e. sending in an application for a job, making a presentation for medical students, etc).I found the book itself to be kind of dry, repetitive reading. There are some good thoughts here -  having a system is a good thing, and knowing/identifying what needs to be done now and what the individual parts of those things are, are important. However, I am not sure if I will adhere to the entire system in my own life, but I do think the general premises here are helpful.",Good ideas here,"September 18, 2016",3.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF65GZUON5TWC42NXNF74I33JNTQ,katarinaism

"I will write a review on the book at large later. This review is simply to say that the Introduction to the Revised Edition and the Welcome to Getting Things Done sections are long-winded and repetitive.

In the Welcome section he states his actual book is comprised of 3 parts with the first part ""[describing] the whole game, providing a brief overview of the system and an explanation of why it's unique and timely.""

It's very logical, and incredibly useful.GTD lets you either:  1) Get more work done, in the same time  ..or..  2) Get your work done, in less time, to have more free time.  :)And, in either case, you will have less work-related stress and anxiety.I cannot recommend it enough.",and incredibly useful.

"It's not life changing for me yet as many people have raved, but it's a great productivity system.  It's a short enough book and a simple enough system that it's worth reading just to pick up a few ideas even if you aren't interested in implementing it fully.  Hey, the simple system for reducing your email inbox to zero is easy to implement and follow and so helpful.I'm about a month into working the system and I am still honing it and learning to trust it, but I am already getting a lot more done.  Basically, the whole point of the book is to write everything you need to do down, break larger tasks into individual actionable items, review it regularly and then just trust the system so you aren't trying to keep everything in your head.If you have dealt with depression or anxiety and I have had trouble with both, been to a therapist and learned a lot about them, then you know that one of the biggest, if not the biggest cause of both are recurring thoughts that keep rattling around in your head.  The ""stress-free"" tagline on the cover is not hype.  Stress=anxiety and it comes from those rattling thoughts going over and over and over and over...in your head.  Writing them down and tracking them in a system like GTD will not remove stress in your life or all of those recursive thoughts that lead to anxiety, but it sure helps.",I would recommend it to anyone whether they use the system the entire system or just cherry pick a few great ideas,"May 20, 2016",5.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGL7TSRS2KN56WBUEM4EI2OCW7FQ,M.

Then it walks you through how to work through your to-do list in order to file items for future use.The method used to walk you through setting up this process is thorough and very practical and easy to apply. Each chapter walks you through another step in the setup, and explains how to avoid pitfalls and tricky areas. The book also provides lots of best practices for managing your system on an ongoing basis.Even if you gain a few small tips from this book, such as how to quickly sift through emails (the 2-minute rule) to a decision tree on actionable items (do it, defer it, delegate it) - anyone will benefit from the advice and best practices outlined.In a way, I think this book is a great companion to the KonMari book ""The Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up"" - it does for your mind what decluttering does for your home.","Pragmatic, useable approach - and great tips!","May 18, 2016",5.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGCRSTWPC27DRHNNYHKERE5JRZBQ,The Craftsman

"This was a good book to help organize tasks when things get overwhelming at work. When I first started as an engineer, things were a lot easier. Now with multiple product lines, multiple facilities, and multiple ""top priorities"" things just got a little out of control. This book really helped put some finishing touches to the processes I was using before so that they could better adapt to the busy new tasks. I've highlighted the sections I used most and will likely review them from time to time.My only complaint with this book is that it is a little wordy. Maybe it's just the engineer in me, but I just wanted to fast forward to the part where it told me what to do, how to do it, and why it is done that way.

I am very grateful that I came across this book. As a forever ne'er dowel who has lived a lifetime of Saturday's I have accumulated much mental dross. I came across this author and his work and now I have the mental freedom to go swimming. My inboxes no longer stay full. My always active mind has a place to put these thoughts in my head and I am not carrying the weight of them in my head. I have no parents no wife no children and very few friends besides my dogs. My clothes can stay on the floor my dishes can stay undone. No one tells me what to do. Even my work is freelance. So it is easy to be without discipline. But I am plagued with a mind that seeks purpose.

"This is a fascinating book that has a completely different viewpoint on staying organized than any other system I've heard of. It is well suited for anyone working in a fast paced career that has a lot of ""knowledge work"" rather than physical work. I was interested to see that I am in fact using a lot of these techniques and that these are some ways of organizing I have found particularly helpful. I've started to use these more broadly and am finding it useful.There are two things the book does not address well, however, though to be fair these things don't necessarily apply to his target audience.(1) What about tasks that are never truly done, such as grocery shopping, cooking, cleaning, and yard work? Yes, there's a finite end if you vacuum your living room, but you just have to do it again the following week. It doesn't really make sense to put these on a calendar since they either don't have to get done on a certain day or there are flexible times when they could be done - the bean soup you have ingredients for could be made either Tues, Wed, or Thurs before the ingredients go bad, for example. And, if you put ""mow lawn"" on the project list, there's not a whole lot of satisfaction that comes from crossing it off, since it'll just be on there again a few days later. This is where I think more traditional models of time management work better.(2) I think the author underestimates the difficulty of getting large projects with no firm deadline done in the midst of a job with a lot of immediate deadlines. Say, for example, you want to write a book while also teaching at a university. If you looked at your project list and calendar every day, you would be drawn to those things that had to be done that instant (grade those papers, prep for the class tomorrow, answer e-mails) and would avoid the book until break times. If you actually want to get the book done, however, it is more effective to block off specific times for it (I will do an hour a day) and then force the other things to take less time in order to accommodate it. I think the author, in other words, leaves the idea of ""what should I do right now"" too open and doesn't give enough specific attention to how you can get the big things done.All this being said, however, I think this is an extremely worthwhile read for anyone who feels overwhelmed!!",Does what it does well ... but doesn't do everything,"May 3, 2016",4.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEGKC45U3ITDNMBRDPTAZVOERA6Q,Chris

"This book was my companion as I tried to grappling with an out of control work schedule and project tasks. I normally take on too much responsibility. I had not learned to say no, and worse, I was no longer in school so the mental strain I experienced from what I thought I was capable of doing and where my performance was at was staggering. Allen's book was my answer. I read it cover to cover over Thanks Giving weekend, and then figured out how I could implement the strategies.I made the mistake of trying to do things piecemeal. I proved futile given the dynamic and fluid nature of the non-profit work I was doing. What ended up happening was that over the Christmas weekend of that year I came in to the office and implemented the full GTD system. That was a needed endeavor and very much paid off in the long run. I have been using his system, a bit updated since I started using the Franklin Covey planners and stopped relying solely on digital note taking and calendaring.This is an incredibly worthwhile read, and the suggestions should be taken as pragmatic applications you have to approach in order to truly make sense of the system.",Returning for fresh inspiration after 8 years of implementing the system.,"April 8, 2016",5.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGUIGWOLPCISOGMFNJZLFOHGIEFQ,Aidan

"Getting Things Done was a wonderful book for three reasons:1) It made you stop and think about your productivity.2) The techniques are simple to understand and their reasoning behind them are explained.3) It had a step by step methodology for implementation of the techniques.The one criticism I would make is that it did at times come off as a cheesy self promoting used car salesman or evangelist in promoting the book and its material.The main focus of the book is this: you need to not be thinking about the things you need to do. If you do this creates anxiety and splits your attention making you less effective than you otherwise would.  Therefore when you are presented with a task or an issue the best way to go about organizing your thoughts is to base your organization on what the next action will be. Allen also writes about how to set up organizationally so that your processes are efficient and useful.Overall, I thought it was an exceptional book and I recommend it to anybody wanting to think about and improve their organization and productivity.",Worth reading.,"March 15, 2016",5.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH457L722OJGF6F3UBR353QKXXCA,Adam Bland

The principles are sound but they are nothing you cannot find elsewhere. The book is more than 300 pages long but you can find the resumed version online in less about 40 pages.

"I hate books in this category that have one or two ideas and spend rest of the time trying to convince you they are right.  This book was highly recommended by another business-skills author, but when I flipped through it, it looked like a lot of text and not much substance.  I WAS WRONG.  I skipped all of the intros and Chapter 1 and dove right in to Chapter 2.  If after reading Chapter 2 and the first half of Chapter 3, you are not convinced this book will be full of great ideas, don't bother reading the rest and just return it.  I, on the other hand, became convinced that reading the rest of the book, going back and reading the intros, and implementing the author's system in all aspects of life, would effect positive change.  I was raving about it to a friend, but I refused to let them borrow it because I know I will be using this book as a reference for the rest of my life.One part of the intro that is very important (but now you can skip it by reading this) is the idea that implementing the full system sounds like a daunting task.  That's OK!  In Chapter 2, add it to your projects list.  In Chapter 3, the author describes how to break down a project of any size and scope.  In Chapter 10, he goes through all the fine details of how to execute a project using all of the tools you learned in Chapters 4-10.",Jam-packed full of ACTIONABLE insights,"February 19, 2016",5.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFJYKDQJV2ME2O42EL4HWW5VEVJA,Kathryn C.

"There is a lot people seem to miss with this system.  Maybe the name is just to easy to replicate.  There are maybe 2 Apps I've seen that work well with what David Allen describes in his book.  One is ThinkingRock the other I forgot because I didn't like it.  I don't know how many people really appreciate the natural way ideas come together that Allen highlights (Purpose, Outcome, Brainstorm, Organize, Identify Next Action).  Allen shows how people either go against the grain or when they bring someone along on the through their thought process, the brought along person doesn't get the essential information (Purposes and Outcomes) and has to work backwards before they can work forwards.  He shows why many meetings are a waste of time. Etc. Etc. Etc.If you're tired of making to do lists and never finishing them, this book will tell you pretty much every mistake you've made and are going to make if you keep your pattern.

"This is an excellent book that has a lasting impact on my life as I have integrated some of it's concept into my life:- Total brain dump- Workflow process- 2 minute rules- Natural project planning model- Action focused / Next action listThe system is perfect if you are in a corporate environnement with the contexts imposed to you: you will act depending on the context.But this system lacks when you are fully responsible from completely shaping your day, as you do in some liberal professions, freelancers, individual entrepreneurs and the such where you are your own accountant. In these cases this books lacks prioritizing system. It could be easy to get stuck on urgent, administrative task if you don't have a plan to ""put first things first"" as would say another author.Another area where this system is lacking is measure of performance and accountability measures.Also the horizon of focus are not very clear.... David Allen seems to be really interested in one thing; micro managing and organizing actions, the rest is secondary.So this system is not a total life management system.... but it can compliment very nicely systems more focused on planning, prioritizing and measure performance.","Not a total life system, but excellent nonetheless","November 13, 2015",4.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEWXCOY2PTQKZWS3X5MNFOKO2ARA,Benj

"GTD suggests people should write down and clarify ideas, and put them into proper system that can help you organize your life on the daily basis. Your mind will not be bothered by random thoughts, you can be freed to focus on more important things, like managing and doing creative works. The concept is attractive, but the book's contents are so disorganized that I find them difficult to understand and put into action.It's easily to regard this book as a thick self-serving promotional flyer. When I read it, I felt it's better for you to hire the writer to help you to understand his system and to get organized. For people who only pay under $20 dollars, you have to read over 200 pages of repetitive and distractive explanation to get a few tips.I respect Mr. Allen devotes so much time and energy to create a system of organization. And he should get appropriate reward for his effort. However, this book is the opposite of his purpose. It's demeaning.Publishing a self-help book without really helping people is not the best strategy to increase brand influence. The readers know what they get.

"This is the book the obsessive-compulsive in you was dreaming of. Like keeping lists? Following flowcharts? Constantly evaluating every little event in your life for its ""actionability""? Then you'll love Getting Things Done.I kind of like the idea of offloading all the various things vying for your attention onto lists, giving your brain the confidence to forget about them. Safe in the knowledge that the lists are complete and will get attended to in time, you can actually get something done - without those nagging worries that there is something else you ought to be doing right now.But what Allen proposes is madness - that's an awful amount of lists-shuffling you're looking at here - and I have a hard time believing the overhead of the system is going to improve anyone's productivity. And even if it did improve it for you, I'd say that if you are at the stage where you need a list of things to do while on-hold in a call, or an itemized reminder of promises made to your spouse, then there are bigger issues affecting your life than suboptimal efficiency.",Useful bits in an otherwise crazy-overhead system,"October 17, 2015",3.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHTSLXVTSKV3X5EZWDMN6WQMKJKQ,Jaroslav Tuček

"Overall I found the book a very good read.  It helped me crystallize a number of ideas about how to organize tasks using simple lists and structures.  The over arching theme I took away is that it is important to have a good organized structured to put ideas immediately into and to trust the structure so that one can free one's mind from constant distractions.What should be put down in this structure are immediate things that are actionable, what one can do next -- as opposed to generalities, which require more thought.  A key aspect of course is breaking down a larger task into these smaller actions.Allen describes a structure of immediate lists to look at, calendars, todo lists, reference lists and so forth.  Other bins include an incubator list for long term tasks and a “waiting for” list, which has tasks that are pending from other people to be completed.  This seems like a sensible arrangement but I suspect that other people will have somewhat different structures.  My impression is that the important idea is not letting immediate short term distractions cloud one's focus on a task, and tackling things sequentially in little chunks.Allen talks a lot about avoiding infinite loops.  He mentions that a long term plan is not something that goes on someone's tickler list but rather something that is broken up into many actions as opposed to only a few.  Practically he discusses how in meetings, before the end of the meeting one really should bring up the question of what is the immediate next action that is a follow up from the meeting rather than just talking in generalities.In the book Allen talks about the importance of having few distractions to really concentrate on the task at hand and one way of achieving fewer distractions is by designing a system to capture all of one's daily input into a well-designed inbox format.  He talks about how if this is well done one does not have the guilt of constantly thinking about things that have to be done nor does one have to have the mental load of things constantly popping into one's mind -- given ones assurance that everything is captured in this universal inbox.  He contrasts a company that has a way of capturing day-to-day tasks as smoothly running without people being interrupted with one that is constantly crisis and event driven.I read this book before the new 2015 edition came out.  This new edition of course needs to be much updated for the new digital reality.  The 2001 edition seems quaint, with its discussion of the correct file folders to use and how to organize things correctly in a close by file cabinet.  It makes reference to a Palm Pilot but this seems almost prehistoric in today's age.That said, I really felt that the lessons in the original 2001 edition were quite timeless.  One could easily see how they morphed into using email programs such as Gmail and perhaps even influenced the design of these systems. In fact, it is fascinating trying to connect a lot of the concepts in this book with the modern world of cloud computing, gmail and various online task sites.  Many of these online productivity tools mimic very closely a lot of the ideas in Allen's work, particularly gmail's immediate function for archiving things from your inbox and putting various tags and stars on them.  It fits very well into a system of de-cluttering your inbox quickly but then coming back to selected bits.Overall I would highly recommend this book, I think it is a good read.","Thoughts on Allen's Getting Things Done - Build a structure for tasks, use it & clear your head.

"The GTD system is life changing. This book describes what is probably the most profficient productivity system which is also different from other techniques by the fact that it is very flexible and can be tailored to anyone. I will never look at my projects with the same attitude as before.I like the way David Allen describes each part of the system, puts it into context and showcases all the subtleties that can come from it. This system is applyable to both professional and personal life, both high tech and low tech guys. He also shows glimpses about different experiences he had with clients in his 30 years of coaching, which is also very helpful to check the real implementation of the system.He also guides the reader about how to approach different principles, for example the 2 minute rule or the weekly review and takes a warm approach when going through all the concepts. He begins by summarizing the context of our world and then goes step by step, putting all the pieces like a puzzle so in the end you have a complete system that memorizes your life. He also explains why this principles work and how our brain is very intelligent about doing creative work and brainstorming, but very stupind in memorizing meetings and dates.This book will change your life. You will realize how much stuff you have under your belt but doesn't make you guilty about it, but rather happy. I experienced an instant relief by applying the first chapters of the book while reading it. It was a rather unusual read as going through the book was mixed with activities like sketching my system, deciding which software to use and doing lots of 2 minute actions as soon as they popped into my head.Definitely recommend this one for those who want to do more and better in life.","If you feel overwhelmed, this book will change your life","September 25, 2015",5.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHU4QUQV4D5EP5QEFH2VJ7GTX4EQ,Iulian Baciu

"This is an outstanding guide to  gathering and writing out  your personal and professional obligations and desires, determining your best personal and professional outcomes, choosing physical actions to advance them, and  reviewing them on a daily and weekly basis to  achieve the goals. I read the 2001 edition. To make it more understandable, I took his work flow charts and color-coded them  in a light-energy sequence: brown for trash, red for reference filing (least movement), orange for someday/maybe (between red reference and yellow deferred action), yellow for deferring  item to a specific day on a calendar (yellow) or next action (yellow-orange), green for delegating item to someone else and waiting for it, light blue for doing an action that requires minimal time, and violet for multi-action projects and their support project plans (most energy required to make it happen). I took about fifteen pages of hand-written notes and color-underlined these terms in my designated colors.  I think the book's ideas could be simplified and presented graphically in a way that would translate  words and concepts to images. His emphasis on handling each item  separately and deciding how to process it reminds me of Marie Kondo's system with household objects.  David Allen has done a great service.

"If you have time for this convoluted mess of a time management program, then you don't need a time management program. You clearly have way too much spare time already. Just use it better.If you do NOT have time for this convoluted mess of a time management program, but you want outside help, try something like Chet Holmes' system. He laid bare everything you really need in about 14 pages of his book The Ultimate Sales Machine (Chapter 1). And that's 14 pages including fluff.Another good resource is the Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule article by Paul Graham. This will help you determine what kind of schedule you really need, based on what kind of work you do.The entire free market economy exists because of people who don't follow crap systems like this one.

"This is a life-changing book. I am not in business but have to function in various domains: working scientist with 20-30 discrete, concurrent, collaborative projects at any given time; teacher; physician; mentor; member of various administrative committees; family man; and avid hobbyist with multiple pursuits. I don't need to read more of the usual inspirational / motivational crap; I'm already highly motivated and willing to work hard, but just needed something to help me organize and get a handle on all the demands placed on me. I'd used calendars and to-do lists like most people but this was not enough.The central message of this book of getting one unified system in place for all projects / tasks in your life and getting things quickly off your mind and into the system is simple yet profound. There is an upfront cost on the order of days, especially if you have a lot on your plate, to get started with such a system. Once you do this, however, keeping it going really only involves a few minutes a day and about 30-60 minutes once a week during a step he calls the weekly review. The key elements that I found helpful: 1) Immediate processing of tasks as they come in (do it if quick, delegate it to others if appropriate, or put it in your system with the appropriate flags; 2) Contexts. it doesn't make sense to look at a list of errands that can only be done on the computer when you are traveling without one or walking the dog. Having each task be assigned to a context (which can be a virtual or physical location) and being able to pull a context-specific list when you are in that context is incredibly helpful; and 3) Next actions. There is a distinction drawn between things that need to happen next (i.e. in the next week) and things that just need to happen at some point in the future. Everything gets tracked, but not everything needs to show up on your context-specific list; just the ""next actions.""This helped me get my life in order and relieved a lot of stress. I no longer worry constantly about what I should be doing because I always know, in any specific context at home or at work, what tasks I have already decided need to happen. Since I also put everything into the system that I trust and know works, I also don't miss things the way I used to.","Even if you are motivated and hard-working, it can still be hard to get things done.

This book is crucial and one I recommend to all young professionals in my organization. It really changed my work life and lead to less stress and more success. The book is dated speaking of Palm Pilots and makes little reference to modern apps and technology. Allen tends to punt on technology overall sticking to principles over digital practice. He does offer companion set-up guides on his website that while overpriced are helpful for setting up key programs like Evernote and Outlook.

"While it is held up as the bible for a particular approach to productivity, it is feeling rather dated and meandering. There are many great nuggets of wisdom, and the overall structure is popular for a good reason. However the world has changed, which means that it feels like a guide book for the 80s and 90s. It wouldn't take a lot to update this.

"Four stars for this book by David Allen. It is difficult to give this book a score as it it should sell as a workshop or training program. Getting all the information from this book down and applied to real life might take weeks or months and you won't be getting much else done. Obviously this is said very much tongue in cheek.I recently read a article on David Allen by Fast Company which put the book into context and it should be read in that context in order to get the most out of it. In this article he mentions the core of the idea behind the book. Getting Things Done (GTD) is a space management system rather than a time management system. He paraphrases one of my favourite quotes by Stephen Covey: “Time management’ is really a misnomer – the challenge is not to manage time, but to manage ourselves."" This is the essence of GTD. Not managing time, but managing yourself to get the most done in the limited time we have.Even if you do not manage to apply the whole GTD system, there are several immediate productivity boosters contained within these pages. Concepts like ""next action"" and the 2 minute rule can make you immediately more effective regardless of what job you do.The GTD system contains 5 basic steps, 1.) capture, 2.) clarify, 3.) organize, 4.) reflect, and 5.) engage. The first is probably the most important and valuable as ""keeping things in your head"" leads to divided attention which leads to a host of other problems.Lastly, having read GTD and then the Fast Company interview with David Allen the whole book and concept just clicked. I would recommend doing the same.","The challenge is not to manage time, but to manage ourselves","August 3, 2015",4.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHJN4FKX7WKDRUMRURGVFVUWDREA,Coen Welsh

"I was an early adopter of David Allen's method when his book first came out. It is now a daily habit and has changed my life. Rereading this after all these years since the first edition gave me a real boost. I notice myself making an extra effort to use his technique and stay organized. I liked reading what he has learned and am incorporating his new ideas into my ""trusted system.""Anxiety due to information overload and juggling the demands of work and home is rampant in our society. I believe that David Allen's basic recommendation to get your tasks out of your head and into your trusted system is a great antidote. His recommendation to identify the ""next action"" you need to take for each of your projects helps keep each project moving toward completion. It takes the pressure off by focusing on one task instead of the entire project.Thanks, David, for completely changing my way of getting and staying organized, especially during times when it feels like I have lost control over my inboxes and my priorities!","If you already read this, it is definitely worth re-reading.","July 29, 2015",5.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFBKKXYQRMSXUM6JO5RBRWEK3YXQ,Foodie

"This book will fulfill its promise if you put in the work the author suggests. It's not easy. It's not a quick fix.

(Writing this from my now clean and well-organized desktop!)A number of negative reviews down the book for its lack of digital-use specifics. Some mock it for referring to file folders and paper in this digital age. There is a large and enthusiastic community of GTD users who use Allen's techniques electronically. Google search Evernote + GTG to see one example for yourself.Allen explains why he does not go into detail about electronics. With so many digital options and personal preferences, and with digital options changing every day, it makes sense to provide the general concepts and let individual users sort the details into their devices, software and cloud resources of choice.Whether your GTD system is all paper, all digital or a combination of both, a good amount of thought and effort is required to make GTD your own and make it work.

"The content of this book is great. I have two very serious criticisms though.First: the layout is incredibly annoying. This may not hold true for the actual print version (I have the Kindle version), but there are inspirational quotes about productivity every 4-5 paragraphs. What is the point of that??? All it does is interrupt the flow of the book and distract the reader. I can understand including a quote at the BEGINNING of a chapter or section, but a quote every few paragraphs is just plain ridiculous.Second: the author takes an inordinate amount of time getting to the actual content. There is a ton of fluff. And he appears to be aware of this, as he asks ""...in the past few minutes, has your mind wandered off into some area that doesn't have anything to do with what you're reading here?"" YES IT HAS, because of the constant interruption of quotes and summaries and the superfluous buildup, three forwards, etc.I will follow up with this once I finish the book.As a disclaimer, I must state that I am only 12% through the book now.

"I am attempting to implement the GTD system so I purchased the latest book.  A previous reviewer mentioned how poorly the book is made and they were 100% correct.  David Allen states it can take up to two years to truly get up and running with GTD but this book will probably fall apart in the next 2 months with any handling.  The binding is poor, the pages are super thin and flimsy.  The material in the book requires some highlighting, marking and note taking however, the quality is not up to the task for sure.  As an example, I underlined some text with a pen very lightly - not only can you see through on the next page but the page ripped with delicate handling. Awful!

"A waste of time and money!  I can't recall the last time a book irritated me so much.  I only made it 45% of the way through it, and that 45% was painful.  Finally, I'd had enough when he said to put each task on a separate piece of paper (are you kidding me?) and then write your first action plan on a yellow sticky stuck on the paper (What?)  I thought this was supposed to be a revised version of his original book (which I never read), but this one still seems stuck in another decade.  Paper? folders? files?  I'm 66, but I've moved on totally electronic myself.  I already scan everything and do everything virtually.  What I was looking for in this kind of a book was how to manage it all (he does discuss that somewhat), but electronically and mentally.This book has several introductions, which were tedious and self-serving.  By the time I finally got to the first chapter, I was already irritated, but then he writes like he's some kind of business theorist, which I guess he is, but really, what we want is not theory but a brilliant plan.

"He's observed and described the human condition as well as Dale Carnegie--I'm tempted to say William James or Bertrand Russell!  And he's developed the Linux of the modern mind: a bit of work to implement, but by far the most powerful, flexible and complete operating system out there, with infinite potential. All that's left to do is to strip down the method to only its mechanics (i.e. minus the supporting and illustrative points) for quick delivery and deployment by those of us willing to try it after chapter 1. Either way, you'll want the full treatment once you've wrested the free time for it.  Read this man's message before you lose another week.I read the Kindle version and have reread it using the Audible edition (which Allen reads himself, and which really added to my sense of him as a genuine, inspiring person).  The text is indispensable as texts often are (especially for the many supporting quotations, and the inset key ideas from Allen, not in the Audible edition), but the audio enables more rapid review and rediscovery. I actually bought a previous Kindle edition a year or two ago, but 'didn't have the time' (he's skeptical of this phrase, as are many others) to read it, and forgot about it.  And to be honest, since the book has no genre it's lumped in with self-help, a not-so-great category I try to avoid.  But it's not self-help; it's an operating system for the most advanced known computer, on which most of us are still running some home-brew nonsense we probably can't defend or even explain.

"I think there are some merits to the GTD philosophy, but it could have been summarized more crisply.  As this is a reboot of the original version, I don't expect Mr. Allen to have shortened the book much, but I do think additional flow charts would have helped for visually oriented readers.  In addition, a lot of quotes are given from authors ranging from Mark Twain to the Brahma Kumaris spiritual organization to Oliver Wendell Holmes.  However, there are several quotes from authors not known to the average non-business background reader (I count myself as the average reader, well-informed on some topics and generally up to date on popular business/self-help/decision-making).  This made the pace a little plodding.To all who have benefited from GTD, I wish you well, but I think the message here could be delivered more effectively.

"Summary:  For anyone new to GTD, go ahead and buy this 2015 version, or save some money and buy the paperback original for $1.50. For anyone who already has a GTD book, just reread it and take a pass on this one, there's really nothing new.I purchased the original in March 2001 for use with my Palm Pilot. I subsequently purchased the Outlook add-in around 2007; and my company had a GTD consultant onsite and provided us access to GTD Connect in 2008. I've found the workflow and methodology useful. The underlying original strength of GTD is that the book not only states ""what"" has to happen, but through a specific methodology also ""how"" to make it happen.I was so excited about this 2015 update, with my expectations of entry to the digital age that I pre-purchased in Nov 2014. Just received the book today and I'm sorry to say that David is essentially punting on digital-age specifics in favor of generalities. Further, David admits that this is not a rewrite (though he did ""retype the original manuscript"").I'm actually fine with the retype vs rewrite though - as he states, the core ideas and methodology of GTD remain the same. But the reason I went to GTD in the first place was that it provided specific workflows incorporating paper and pencil and Outlook and PDAs - he had done the work to figure out what works and I was happy to adopt his recommendations.Since the original release there has been a profound shift in the use of technology - hardware, software, mobile and cloud. 2015 finds us in much more diversified and integrated data input/output environment than what the Palm and MSOffice suite offered in 2000, and so there is a very good reason to update the ""how"" part of the equation to manage this new information capture and task-list ecosystem.In the new edition, the author provides some digital guideline feature specifics (software outline program should allow for sub-headings, expand/collapse ability), even more generalities, but mostly just derails the digital conversation of any 'how' by sweeping particulars under the carpet with a few ambiguities of ""what"" needs to be done, not ""how"" to do it, ""Make sure you create comfort with the [computer] applications [""used for developing and capturing project plans and collateral""]. It will behoove you to do regular reviews and updating of this content and keep it current with consistent purging and reorganizing.""Punting on digital specifics of today's workflow world because, in his words, “the rate of innovation in this area means that any specific software program can easily be outdated, upgraded, or undermined by the next new thing"", and that he has admittedly ""hopped out of the fray, opting instead to provide a general model for how to evaluate the usefulness of any tool"" is, for me, not useful. I *know* there is a plethora of digital tool options, and I wanted him to do the work and figure out what works. Fine, publish a revision when the tools change, I'll buy it. That's why he and his team get paid the big bucks. But if I wanted to spend my time figuring the complexity of tools out myself I'd have done that from day one. To me, this would be like Lonely Planets back-peddling on restaurant and hotel reviews. ""Oh, there are just sooo many these days, let us tell you what to look for instead,,,, try to find a restaurant with lots of people in it, and look for a hotel with clean sheets."" Uh, yea.The original methodology and task-driven workflow remains true in the 2015 book as in the original. The ""psycap"" and other psychological drivers and underpinnings are interesting in the new book. But whereas I was confident that I had a pretty holistic system set-up as a result of the original book (and actually, as much a result of a smaller digital footprint, and I know I'm not the exception), I now feel, with this ""completely updated"" edition, that I have half a system with a digital divide, a ""black hole"" as the author even alludes.I understand all the high reviews, the methodology is still very good as described, and yes, freshened. My rating of this book is as a version updated for what we would all agree is an increasingly digital world and unfortunately, whereas the ""what"" might be explained, I find the book lacking on the ""how"". I agree  that it has helped me refine my thinking about how to use GTD in the digital age,,, i.e., I now think that I cannot rely just on this one book as a holistic model of how to get it all done ;)For anyone new to GTD, go ahead and buy this 2015 version, or save some money and buy the paperback original for a $1.50 and you'll learn the essentials that have not changed. For anyone versed in GTD, I offer David's statement from this new book: ""...whenever anyone loops back through the material, they invariably have a response like, ""Oh my God, this is totally different information and perspective"" than what they had remembered from earlier, ""it was a totally different book each time!"" So if you have an earlier GTD book? Just reread it and you'll likely get the same ""new"" experience and fresh perspective as from this 2015 book, particularly given that there really are no digital age specifics that many of us were hoping for.","A retype not a rewrite, punts on digital tool specifics in favor of generalities, still a good methodology","March 19, 2015",2.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEFFQN7QCIQ5EABQR3WSW6P2W6LQ,Amazon Customer

"I wish I'd read this when it first came out.  I read the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People when it first came out decades ago, and I still follow the approach today.  HOWEVER...the daily execution was always missing.  7 Habits addresses ""what"" and ""why"", but Getting Things Done addresses the ""how"".  Ideas, planning, and priorities are important factors to manage, and GTD addresses the daily ""how"".  I have never been so organized, so tidy (well, at least less messy -- parts of the surface of my desk are visible at all times!) and felt so ""tidy in the mind"".  With thoughts, lists, ideas, next steps, etc. all out of my brain and into an organizing system (Outlook, an organizer, and file folder), my mind is less cluttered with ""stuff"" (as David Allen says), and free to deal with important things.  I have never thought of myself as particularly organized, so when my boss told me ""You're really well organized"" (as I whipped open my organizer and referred to my meeting agenda that was a printout of my Agenda folder in Outlook -- all suggestions from GTD), I know I was onto something.

"Hi everyone,I used to be super disorganized, and would constantly strive to find new ways of being production without being messy.  Papers would scatter my desk, post-it notes would be placed everywhere--I was getting really tired and frustrated with doing everything by hand.  My friends at work told me to read David Allen's book: ""Getting Things Done.""  The concept of GTD has completely changed my life, and it is super, super EASY to adopt.  GTD has become something of a movement lately, and many apps and developers have started to copy and incorporate GTD concepts into their systems.  At first, I was frustrated that an app didn't exist for GTD.  Since I am glued to my iPhone and Mac now, I tried to use Evernote (yes I know it's popular) but it just didn't do it for me...luckily I found a cool new app called Taskorami.  It used to only be available on Windows 8, but has since been adapted to be available on many different devices including the iPhone.  I couldn't recommend Taskorami enough, as I use it for EVERYTHING now!Hope this helps!",Apps For GTD,"February 27, 2015",5.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEUHLHWEHOS6PA4YEDC2F6T6FB5A,Zack

"David Allen’s Getting Things Done describes a very powerful system for controlling the long list of to-do items we all carry around in our heads. I have been using parts of this system since 1985.The basic principle is straightforward – write down everything you want to do – or might want to do – and keep those lists orderly and accessible. Get everything out of your mind and into this system and clear your mind, which, in theory, should make you more peaceful and consequently more effective. Your increased effectiveness, in theory, should make you more peaceful. And so on.Also, to become more peaceful and clear, get EVERYTHING off your desk. Unclutter your office, too.You might wonder why an entire book would be necessary to learn how to do this. You would be right to wonder, as most of the book is, in fact, an explanation of why it is better to not be anxious and what happens when your office and life are messy. Then much of that is restated in different words.Nonetheless, I encourage you to buy the book, because it will increase your commitment to using a system, perhaps this one. After all, you have known since you were 14 years old that is it better to be organized, and it may be possible that you haven’t lived that way.Here are the basics from the book:Get every possible item off of your desk and out of the pile on your windowsill and from the top of the filing cabinet. Everything.Write down every single possible thing you might ever want to do, see, look up, accomplish, plant, complete, give away, or build. Here is the key principle of the entire book and the entire system (it may actually be the key to life, the thing the guru on the top of the mountain should tell you): FOR EVERY SINGLE THING YOU THINK YOU NEED TO DO, DEFINE THE NEXT SPECIFIC, SINGLE ACTION STEP NEEDED TO ACCOMPLISH IT.Not “buy a car.” Not “look at Consumer Reports for car reviews.” Not “keep your eyes open for good looking cars.” Instead, “go online to Consumer Reports to learn which issue has the latest car reviews.” That’s it. If you can do that, everything else is easy.Write each of these next action steps on one of these lists: next action, projects, calendar, waiting for, someday/maybe. Except, if the item would take less than two minutes, do it right now.Put everything in an accessible and obvious place. (Rule of Jenny: Everything has a place, and it’s not “out.”) Buy a label maker and label your files at the moment you create them. On your desk, you are free to keep only these things: supplies, equipment, decoration, and reference. That’s it.Go through your lists regularly. Weekly reviews work for most people. Monthly may be better for you.To recap, for every single thing you think you need to do, define the next specific, single action step needed to accomplish it. The rest is icing on the cake.Buy the book. But feel free to skip over any sentence, paragraph, or chapter that seems to be explaining the benefits of getting organized. There are many such paragraphs.If you want to save some time, here are the most valuable sections (page numbers from the Penguin paperback edition of 2001):The Principle: Dealing Effectively with Internal Commitments (p. 12-18)The Major Change: Getting It All Out of Your Head (p. 21-23)Getting Control of Your Life: The Five Stages of Mastering Workflow (p. 24-53)Brainstorming (p. 70-74)Getting Started: Setting Up the Time, Space, and Tools (p. 85-103)Processing: Getting ""In"" to Empty (p. 119-137)Organizing: Setting Up the Right Buckets (p. 138-180)As I noted, I have been using some of these tools since 1985, when I attended a David Allen time management seminar. The tools have been helpful. I am committed to getting the rest of my time organized, thanks, in large part, to this book. I hope it helps you.","very good system, but way too long for the content","December 26, 2014",4.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFHR2XJILPZAAYO3N2EMXPS3JGAQ,David Rubenstein

"I was unable to finish reading this book. Made it about 1/3 of the way through, before I:a) Got incredibly boredb) Got incredibly annoyed at the author's presumptuousnessIt may seem implausible that one could simultaneously be both bored and annoyed, yet I managed to.Let's face it, time management is not a very sexy topic to begin with, so I wasn't expecting to be wowed. Yet I found myself very anxious for the author to pick up the pace. The book is hundreds of pages long, but if I'm going to follow any system of organization the latter had best be able to be boiled down to a dozen pages - otherwise it will be too complex to comprehend and adhere to. So in my mind, the author was taking 20 pages of explanation and supporting text per one page of condensed principals. I might accept a 10:1 ratio, but not 20:1.The other major problem is that this book seems aimed at wealthy corporate executives and not the everyday person. As recent research has shown, those with lower income levels find it difficult to make good decisions in areas like financial management, likely due to the tremendous day-to-day pressures they endure simply trying to make ends meet. At the very least, the book should be inclusive enough so that those in unfortunate financial shape will feel like the content applies to them.Instead, page after page of the book comes across as elitist, reading more like an article you'd find in the New York Times' Business or Wealth sections. For example, relatively few of us are concerned with starting a new division or business. And when the author had a sample ""to-do"" list that included ""building a koi pond,"" I nearly lost it. If you have enough property and money to consider building a koi pond, I say just hire a full-time concierge to take care of all the items on your list, so you can go play golf.I must also say that I found the author's recommended strategy (or as much as I managed to read) a challenge to understand. I found myself going back and re-reading portions of it to try to fully internalize it. I think clearer graphics would have helped.It is always possible that the first third of the book (which I read) was not representative of the latter portion. If so, I apologize, but I gave it a fair shot before I wrote this review.",Gave up early,"November 23, 2014",2.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFDA2T2P7O3LZIYL6X2RRGAIPV3Q,My Stuff

"I have already been doing 80% of what he suggests for most of my 20+ year professional career. The extra 20% which I picked up from this book made all the difference. The key items which I gained from this book were to make my to-do lists context specific, to add my someday-maybe and all my personal/around the house/family to-do items to their own lists to get them out of my head, and to ensure I have next action items for everything not just nebulous goals. These additional insights have helped me get much more done every day. The book is longer than it should be, but it is still a quick read. It could probably be 30-50 pages, but then people might balk at paying for such a short book. The examples and stories may be needed to convince some, but the plain truth and efficacy of his suggestions really does speak for itself. If you never seem to get to the bottom of your to-do lists and constantly have things which fall through the cracks, you will benefit immensely from this book. If you are pretty organized, but sometimes forget things or ever have down time, but aren't sure what to do at that moment to be productive, this book will help you too. I have found that Microsoft OneNote is the perfect tool to keep these lists on my work computer, laptop, tablet, and phone.","If you are already productive and utilize to-do lists, this book will help take your system to the next level.","November 4, 2014",5.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGWURFGS5WQUCTJKUVJX5D5ZBMFQ,Robert Boyle

"This is a really good book on organization. I only have a few complaints. The first is that this book seems dated. It assumes that we still live in a paper age. There's nothing wrong with that per se, but I'm in an IT department. We are trying to get away from using paper and going to more electronic forms of ""Getting things done"". His thoughts and ideas are able to be used with email. I would recommend maybe a second book entitled ""Getting things done in the information age"".The second compliant is like most management books this one is read and pass on. It doesn't stay in your library to be re-read over the years. There's nothing wrong with that. A lot of management books are like that, but the ones that have the deepest impact never leave your book shelf.Overall, I would recommend this book. It will help you become better organized.

"The promotional material was a bit of a stretch - but, I suppose that's what it takes to sell a product that is definitely in the commodity stage of its existence. Mr. Allen's approach is pretty straightforward - get organized, use a ""to do"" system that you will really use - check it daily, then have the discipline to do what you said you would do.Doing what it said it would do is exactly what this book does. It is a system for organization of ""to do"" reminders, resources and filing systems.There is ample psychological coaching and human nature background material (8th grade level stuff, so don't look for great insights) to put the suggestions in perspective.All in all a worthy and useful mechanical approach to behavior management and organization (aka ""time management"").",Good mechanical approach to age-old issue,"September 20, 2014",4.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFBXAEDITBGOA443RV5JTATOF7UA,WJ

"A top book in anyone's arsenal who is struggling with time management, productivity, and overall sanity in their personal or professional lives!This book helped me to realize that all time management isn't really time management; it's actually TASK management!  ""Getting Things Done"" by David Allen is a LIFESAVER when it comes to helping you get out of the piles & piles of ""work""—whether personal or professional—that needs to get done or is just scraping at the back of your mind like nails on a chalkboard.But if you're looking for a quick fix method move on because this process, if you want it to really work and do it right, takes a little time to implement.  The good news about this, though, is that I was able to first look up a couple videos on YouTube with David Allen interviews/workshops and implement some of the simplest tips in the book into my everyday life as a ""trial"" before purchasing the book.  As a result, just these few tips made a HUGE difference!For example, when you realize that your brain is wired to create new ideas but not to store them, just by the act of writing everything down that's in your head on separate sheets of paper and placing those notes into your current or soon-to-be-created Inbox, you'll feel the immense relief of having your mind free to do what it's meant to do—think!  Just this one tip alone allowed me to realize that, yes, I could in fact get back control of my completely overwhelmed life and STAY in control!If you're still reading this and wondering whether to purchase it or not, do what I did:1. Check out a couple of YouTube vids by David Allen on ""Getting Things Done"".2. Implement the simplest strategies from the videos into your own life.3. Buy the book and—most importantly—refer to it over and over again throughout the course of your year.4. Take back control of your LIFE!!!If you've tried Stephen Covey's ""The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People"" quadrant method of time management and you're still finding it hard to manage your time and your life, give ""Getting Things Done"" a chance; not as a replacement, but a complimentary book by two authors on the same path to creating more FREEDOM in your life.","A top book in anyone's arsenal who is struggling with time management, productivity, and overall sanity in their personal or pro","September 15, 2014",5.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHFOJD65ECM4X7GXER3U6HYYKJTA,"Eric Beaty, Author of the SMART FOCUS series"
"This book became the core of a case-management methodology for my law firm. It is a life-changing book. David Allen knows more about this subject than Steven Covey, because he gives vital tools to actually manage a heavy workflow without dropping balls or becoming stressed out.My firm uses Daylite software (from Marketcircle) as the core of our GTD system, but there are many other applications you can use. Without the knowledge of Allen''s method, however, you won't get as much out if the software you use to manage your tasks.The book is easy to read, and relatively short, with no fluff or filler whatsoever.

"The Getting Things Done system is a good system. It has helped me organize my life and feel a lot less stressed out. The Getting Things Done book, on the other hand, is just okay.The system is essentially all about managing a massive to-do list that contains every ""open loop"" (a term the author uses to describe anything in your life that isn't the way that you want it to be). The goal is to get it all recorded in a way that is reliable as a source of useful reminders so that you don't feel the subconscious urge to keep reminding yourself of things that you can't currently act on (like remembering to buy milk when you're not at the store). The book goes into great detail about this and it goes to great lengths to provide relevant examples for every step of how to tackle your huge pile of ""stuff"" so that it is all accounted for in your system.The book could have been much shorter. Especially toward the end, I felt as though it had become a bit of a slog to get through it all because I had gotten the idea already and had a working system but felt the need to read page after page of what seemed like filler text to pick out useful tidbits I might otherwise have missed. I understand that repetition is useful for memorization, but even having broken the reading of the book up over several months, I felt it repeated too much, too often.I read the book using the Kindle format. For the most part, the Kindle format was fine. There was one section of one chapter that had incorrect formatting (it was entirely formatted as one very long header), but no glaring problems beyond that which were specific to it being in the Kindle format.","Great system, okay book","September 11, 2014",3.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEKIBK2CPPGQ3D5DDWA3OX5PX7LA,Chris

"The world is a very different place than it used to be.  Things were much quieter, slower, and simpler back then.  The world is advancing at such a rapid pace that the only way to keep up is to do many, many different things.  Naturally what someone considers a priority in their life varies person from person.  I don't care whether you are a farmer, head CEO, average joe who works at starbucks, or an electrician... There is ALWAYS something more to do.  There never seems to be enough time in the day to do what we need.  That's a pretty well known, and well understood phrase.  Unfortunately, it's completely WRONG and we all buy into it.This book can help anyone realize that.  The problem with us humans is that we are incredibly inefficient and waste a lot more time than we think we do.  We think we are being busy when really we aren't doing anything.  David Allen lays out a methodology for anyone to organize their lives in such a way that they can quite literally double their productivity.  I think that's what separates the successful from the unsuccessful.  The successful people in this world naturally do these things.There are already several reviews on here detailing everything out so I won't bother doing that but it boils down to cleaning your mess up 100% so you can start with a clean head (because the brain is for creating ideas not storing ideas) and take new and incoming challenges on one at a time.  I won't lie and say that its an easy read.  Some of it is but some of it isn't. When he tells stories it can be quite the page flipper.  However, once he gets into the nitty gritty of how the system needs to operate it can be real easy to stall.  Consider it like an instruction manual for your life.  Every instruction manual has parts that are just plain boring but need to be in there.  It really takes the chaotic, jumble of life and organizes everything into an easy to maintain system of clarity and purpose.That being said, applying all of these principles may make one seem robotic in nature and very precise in function but lets be honest... computers are VERY good at what they do.  So why shouldn't we?  I'm not advocating for an IRobot kind of society where everyone is perfect and exact but implementing even a portion of his advice will improve productivity output and reduce stress.  He's not kidding when he says ""the art of stress free productivity"".  Belongs on every person's library who wants to get ahead in the game we call life.",Instruction Manual for life,"August 21, 2014",5.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHDVAUIWRQSIZZM36AACDN7OKKXA,VA Raider

"""Getting Things Done"" is probably the most popular time management book ever written, yet it took me quite a while to read. It wasn't the size as the book is only 250 pages (and it should be less), but I guess I had read too much time management books in the past and figured it would be similar. GTD is similar, yet also different. It feels simpler, more concrete and more bottom-up (the last one raises some worries for me).The book consists of 3 parts. They are roughly: 1) Overview of GTD, 2) Same more detailed, 3) Same explained from principles. And this also shows my key comment on the book (and I believe other reviewers pointed this out many times also), the book is quite repetitive.The first part contains 3 chapters. Of these, basically chapter 2 is the overview of the GTD method and is the most important chapter to read. The latest chapters will be mostly a repetition of chapter 2. Chapter 3 discusses project planning and the ""natural way of planning"" which I found myself a bit less interesting (plus a gross misuse of the term brainstorming).The second part elaborates on the GTD method and has a chapter of each of the GTD steps: 0) preparing 1) collecting, 2) processing, 3) organizing, 4) reviewing, 5) doing. Each repeats the steps from chapter 2 and then elaborates on them. As the GTD method is fairly simple, most of the elaboration doesn't add very much. The last chapter again makes the side-track to projects (which I think could have been removed from the book).The last part introduces 3 principles behind GTD 1) Power of Collecting, 2) Power of Next-Action Thinking, 3) Power of Outcome Focusing. Each repeat the same information as earlier chapters, but add a bit more conceptual thinking to it.Overall, I enjoyed the book despite the repetition. I felt GTD has a lot of good things in it and it definitively tries to keep things simple. I've been at times worried with the bottom-up approach but on the other hand feel the author has a fair point that you can't concentrate on purposes when you are constantly swamped with things. Anyways, I think GTD can help a lot of people gain more control of their life and time, thus a useful book. 4 stars for its repetitiveness though.

"I had bought this book a few years ago for my dad, and had leafed through that copy. When I got my kindle and saw the price, I decided to buy a copy for myself as well.This book is a classic for a reason. It gives a straightforward method for getting yourself organized. Sure, it takes some effort to keep up with all of the tips that Mr. Allen recommends, but it is definitely worth it. I have figured out ways to use my email / calendar / to do functions, along with a Google Doc list of ""big projects."" And like I said, I spend probably 10-30 minutes each day on the organization, depending on what the day holds, but the results are worth it. I am able to stay on top of things, and I find that having all the ""to dos"" spelled out in one place is very motivating; I like crossing things off of my list.Probably my favorite technique that I learned from this book is to keep a ""tickler,"" which is the method of reminding yourself of tasks to begin in the future. Like, on July 8th I need to write a letter to someone congratulating them on an award he's set to receive on July 7th. Without my ""tickler,"" I would not be able to remember to do this task on July 8th.Highly recommended!",great for getting & staying organized,"June 28, 2014",5.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGKGE6L3SWMRXT2QZLTA5NFJJK6Q,Chiara
"The  book was a bit of a ""slow read"" as a lot of it seemed to be explaining why you're being told what you're being told.  I understand this is often needed, but at times it made reading the book a chore, when you were wanting to get to the meat of the subject.That being said, the information relayed was terrific.  Not only has it changed the way I do things, but I've referred it to a number of my colleagues, including to a continuing education class I just taught to a bunch of accountants (which had nothing to do with productivity).  Several members of the class have already started on the book and the methods it describes.","A slow read, but great information","June 28, 2014",4.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF7T2A3MVBOMXFTQIAZFBGXZTBRA,Allen Phillips

"Admittedly I was late to the GTD party. After leaving the corporate world more than a decade ago and forging ahead with my own business I fell behind on the personal development initiatives that were a regular part of my previous cooperate culture. Lately, I had come to grips with the reality that my personal bandwidth had been at max levels for far to long and the ramifications were way too many dropped balls, an uncomfortable stress level, and a far less than balanced lifestyle.This book is one of the most important books I have ever read. It gave me a usable system to dig out of overwhelmed and to stay out of overwhelmed. And even more importantly, I feel like I'm thinking more clearly than I have in quite some time as this wonderful GTD system facilitates more higher level thinking and much better quality creative idea generation. Yep, I had to change some habits and many of processes, but the payoff was HUGE.While there were certainly more ah-ha moments in the earlier chapters and the fundamentals of the system were unveiled. I felt the later chapters were extremely helpful in cementing the ideas and giving me more practical examples of how they are best implemented.Granted, the book is a tad dated and could use an update that would incorporate some of the newer technology and software tools that can help you to more efficiently implement the GTD system. But after reading the book and understanding the necessary components of the system, anyone with a internet browser can certainly search out the apps/software tools that best fit their needs. I'm Apple based (MacBook Pro, iPad,&  iPhone) ended up with a combination of OmniFocus 2 (Task Management) and Evernote (additional inbox and comprehensive reference system) and Magical Pad (outlining and mind mapping) to have everything i need to fully implement the GTD system for me across all platforms I regularly use.The value of this book to me in incalculable. If you are super stressed with everything you have to do and everything that's still undone, overwhelmed with keeping up with your various responsibilities, retreating from your life rather than engaging it, then get this book and read it RIGHT NOW. However, be clear it is not a panacea in and of itself. You have to implement the ideas and it will take some time to fully integrate. You are most definitely going to have to be willing to give up some habits and processes that are not serving you in favor of some that will. But the uncomfortableness of the new learning curve and the different organizational system will subside soon enough and the immense benefits will be so worth the effort.",Tremendously helpful philosophy and methodology allowing you to more consciously engage and more fully participate in your life,"June 15, 2014",5.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGB2CUAHMBMWY4KWRVEXZKIYFOUQ,Stephanie A Padilla

"1. Misleading Title:This book is to literally organize your things not necessarily to get things done. Seems like the Getting Things Done system is a way to file things rather than truly getting things done like prioritizing, multitasking, how to handle things that come out of the blue and you have a ton of things on your plate.2. Same content over and over again:Seems like they had to stretch the content of this Getting Things Done system in order to make the book. Their answer to stretching the content was repeating the same thing by saying it in different ways. I took detailed notes of the book because it's really wordy and confusing. By chapter 6, I found myself going back to the notes I had already taken and only adding a thing or two because they were repeating the exact same thing with a sentence of new information.3. Painful to read:The way this book is written is just painful to read.

GTD is considered by many entrepreneurs and executives to be one of the most effective and indispensable methods for getting your life in order. I’ve always been a list maker, but this book is a guide on how to make the right lists.

"I'm a busy person. Aren't we all? My day begins at 5:45 AM and ends at 11:30. From the moment I wake up to the moment I go to bed, I'm constantly doing. I do not like that about myself, nor the community that I'm a part of. Still, that's my reality and I need to manage it.I was talking with a colleague at an out-of-town conference one day, and mentioned how exasperated I was. He reached into his bag and pulled out a copy of ""Getting Things Done."" He urged me to take his copy and to read it on the train back home. Reading, and then employing the GTD system, has changed my way of thinking, and my way of being in my relationship, in my work, and in my community. I am a calmer person because of it.I have always been a lists person. Each morning, I would come in and make a list of all the things I needed to get done, but was constantly overwhelmed by it all. GTD gave me a way to break it down, and process the stuff that was coming at me. The system gave me a way to prioritize, organize, and then get the tasks accomplished so that I wasn't constantly drowning in work.I still need to be better about the amount of work I take on. I need to practice saying ""no"" more. Nonetheless, GTD has given me a way to take the rock-pile of work that sits on top of my desk and in my computer, and allowed me to say to myself, ""You do not have to feel like Sisyphus all the time.""Since I implemented the GTD system, I have bought copies for my staff. Each have found his or her own way to implement the system. I have noticed a considerable drop in stress in our office, and a certain boost in morale.Finally, because GTD has freed my mind from much of what worries me, I have found myself more present for others. I am able to focus in meetings better. And I am able to be fully present in personal interactions, more. For me, GTD has become a spiritual practice.

"First of all, I have to admit that as a chronically disorganized procrastinator, I didn’t really believe that this book could actually help me and this purchase was more or less a shot in the dark.  That said, I ended up mentally exclaiming stuff like, “YES! THAT’S TOTALLY HOW I FEEL!” and “Wow! This guy really does get it!” as I read the first section of the book.  The system proposed by Allen as detailed in the pages that followed basically included a lot of common sense things that I have already tried to keep up with doing (i.e., keeping track of your ‘to do’ items in writing, setting reminders for yourself, use Outlook calendar to store things that must be done at a specific time on a specific date), but I would describe it as “common sense in HD and on steroids.”What I loved the most about this book is that Allen focuses not just on a plan to get rid of your “to do” list for that day (and in fact, tells you to stop using a daily to do list, period!), but actually provides a way to organize your entire life – including both professional and personal aspects.  This is important for me because I can’t really segment my life into “personal” and “professional.”  There is a lot of spillover both ways.  This system helps with keeping “the big picture” in mind at all times, but not in an interfering, stress-causing kind of way.  Up until reading this book and starting to adopt the system, my future goals never factored into my day-to-day life.  It has been a constant rotation of too many things to do and not enough time to do them.  I will say that just after taking the first steps of ‘setting up the space’ and clearing out the clutter in my office at home, I felt a tremendous sense of satisfaction and really felt motivated to continue adopting the system.  Prior to taking the first step, I was well aware that my office clutter was probably contributing to the stress, but always felt “I don’t have the time to take care of it” and would put it off, thinking “There’s too much to do right now.  Maybe later.”  Well, to all of you who are thinking you just don’t have the time… I took this first step and the world did not end!Now for the cons… As several other reviewers state, this book is laden with “corporate buzzword” speak.  Towards the late middle and end of book, the “system” gets to be a little too efficient (for me, anyway), with sub-classifications for sub-classifications for sub-classifications (which maybe this will make sense to me later down the line… I’m just not completely organized yet).  It’s still a great book, though  - and adopting some of these practices has helped me to become more decisive, thereby decreasing my level of stress a little bit.I am not anywhere near the “mind like water” state and have only just recently started to use the methods described in the book; however, the more I adopt these seemingly simple but oh-so-difficult-to-change-current-behavior-and-employ principles, the closer I feel myself move towards it.

"I like his tactics.  I'm only on page 353 (on my ipad) out of 4445, read it while I was on a 3 hr trip in the car (because I am so stressed that each second I feel I should be working on something, so it was hard to get to it).  But then figured might as well as a passenger on a trip and all I had was my ipad.  Time well spent anyways, it's already helped make me realize my issues.  Also take the time and read it because I've read other places that if you are stressed you are less productive, so it's only hurting you to read it.  I've heard some of these things before in the book, but some not, anyways it helped, you mainly just have to do it.

"The author is articulate and precise in what he recommends and this book is actionable. Everything is explained clearly and with examples and reasoning for why the system is designed a certain way.The book suffers heavily from corporate buzzword speak. When I first began reading it, I hardly understood anything because my brain automatically filters out words and phrases like ""paradigm shift"" ""10000 feet view"" ""synergy"" ""leverage"" ""vertical integration"" etc. as bull (which is what it's usually used as in the corporate world). I have been using some form of the systems prescribed in this book for a few months now, and it has helped me reach a much better understanding of what I want and how to get it.If you're serious about getting your life together, this is a handy system for you. HOWEVER, if you are presently unmotivated or uninspired or are just generally dejected, pass on this book for now, it will just gather dust on your shelf. It takes an initial burst of motivation to get the systems set up.

"I can honestly say that IF you FULLY implement the Getting Things Done system it will change your life for the better.  This is the third time I have read the book, which I did in response to changing from a paper based GTD system to an electronic - cloud based system.  I now have Evernote serve as my in-basket.  With the Evernote Android widget on my cell phone I can literally ""capture everything"", get it out of my head and into the system. I have Evernote's Reminder functionality send my Next Actions Tasks, Projects Lists, and Tickler Files to the Android Program ""Remember the Milk""  where I can tag and sort them by multiple contexts. The system described in the book was great on paper.  It is flat out amazing in the cloud.  The hardest part using it in my current setup was working through the nuances of getting the ""capture"" part (evernote) feeding information smoothly in to the ""tasks and contexts"" part (remember the milk), but that is an issue with technology, not the information in the book.David Allen's metaphors may be the subject of debate, as noted in other reviews, but in simple ""change the world to be more like you want it to be"" terms I don't think you will find a better system.Feel free to leave comments if you need more info of how I set up my cloud services...","Life Changing, IF you put in the effort...","May 2, 2014",5.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFSRNJ2FMDRFNQPGBNTMAY7CQ3NQ,Paleo

"I've heard a lot about this method from various places, so I thought I would read the whole book. I've been pegged as a ""creative"" and ""right-brained,"" and my organization methods show it. I recently found myself getting very overwhelmed by all the different projects I have going at once and needed something to help me get moving on some of them. The book is definitely more oriented toward business-types, but I still thought I could get something out of it.The book has helped me see my projects and tasks at the different levels described. Most useful to me was getting everything possible that needed to be done in one location (for me this was on paper), identifying projects vs. actions, the next actions list (more detailed than a To Do list), and the popular two-minute rule. I have incorporated much of this into a Bullet Journal system, and I do find myself much less stressed, because I'm no longer using sticky notes and scraps of paper to remind myself of things. If I do, I put them in an inbox, which I also use to some extent.The inbox is where I got lost for a while and put the book down for a few weeks. Maybe if I were paying someone to come in and help me get organized, I would have been able to plow through the towering mountain of work this entailed. Since I recently started a business, I found it near impossible to set aside days, which is what I would need, to attempt this process. I opted to use my Bullet Journal as a type of inbox where I wrote things down instead of gathering them into a physical inbox.I will admit I was also put off by the corporate attitude of the whole book. While I might run my own company, I didn't feel like the book was speaking to me much of the time. The whole method also seems very dependent on checking each and every day, reviewing your lists, keeping on top of it all. And maybe this is the real key to organization, but it's not appealing to someone like me who likes to go hide away in a corner with her typewriter and forget the world exists for hours. After 45 years of existence, I've realized I am not the kind of person who is going to be the model of corporate efficiency.With that said, I am using some of the methods, and it has helped ease my mind. I no longer have random lists and notes everywhere (except the strays I haven't caught yet) but one central location where I keep projects, future projects, and next actions. I also quit putting things off so much by using the two-minute rule. So I got some useful information from the book, but it took me a while and required me to let go of the idea I was going to be able to follow all the rules as written.",Creative People Can Adapt The Methods To Be Useful,"April 15, 2014",3.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AG3DLO5UWD3MBJMFBVM7G4VVUYCA,Cindy

"“Which do you think is the more efficient way to move through life – deciding next actions on your projects as soon as they appear on your radar screen and then efficiently grouping them into categories of actions that you get done in certain uniform contexts, or avoiding thinking about what exactly needs to be done until it has to be done, then nickel-and-diming your activities as you try to catch up and put out the fires?” (pp. 244)This statement represents what I feel to be the crux of David Allen’s semi-infamous Getting Things Done , a book that, I have discovered, has its fair share of faithful adherents and passionate detractors online. As I read the quote above, I personally think to myself, “Both sound like unpleasant scenarios, but if I had the self-discipline the former would clearly be the preferable choice.” Whether the system advocated in Getting Things Done works for you will largely depend on just that: how far you are willing to go to plan and organize your life – in areas of macro and micro importance –, and how much self-discipline you can muster.To be honest, I was quite skeptical about reading yet another self-help book. There was a time when I ate this kind of literature up, but I have, in recent years, grown rather tired of it. Perhaps it’s an indication of my laziness, or an indication of how trite the genre becomes once you’ve read and familiarized yourself with several of the “core” concepts (and experienced the disappointment of not being able to implement the advice as easily as the author(s) purport you can). Was David Allen going to offer me yet another panacea for my personal and professional problems?Yes and no. In truth, I have only just finished the book and have not had time to put his practices to the test yet. But on a purely abstract level (i.e., having only read and considered the material), I am actually quite impressed with Allen’s methodology. There is nothing simple about it, but it is thorough and consistent. The writing and explanations are clear. Compared with most self-help literature, the material is actually quite fresh and stimulating. While reading I felt a mixture of excitement and dread: excitement about the potential of this productivity methodology, and dread about attempting to implement it, because I could envision how difficult it would be. Make no mistake about it: unless you have extraordinary self-discipline, I cannot imagine this system being the least bit functional. But with the proper self-discipline in action, I don’t doubt Allen’s system could do wonders to one’s productivity.Most of the complaints I have read against this book have seemed rather shallow. “There’s too much planning involved”; “The system is too complex to implement very easily”; “The author is a cultist”; etc. Even if you don’t attempt to incorporate the system into your life in full, there is plenty of material here to pick and choose from, adapting to your personal tastes and needs. For me, personally, the idea of assigning an action item to every actionable task and/or project in my life sounds like a very compelling strategy against procrastination. As a precursor to that, developing a habit of getting all of my tasks and projects on paper, so I don’t forget about them, also seems to be a very attractive (albeit intimidating) practice. Using the book’s advice, I was able to quite easily rearrange my email inbox in a way that allows me to sort between actionable tasks, reference material, and in-process emails.My biggest gripe with the book is probably the fact that it feels somewhat dated. By that I mean, Allen talks about using PDA’s and word processors like they’re hot new technology. In the digital age, the core of Allen’s system seems to require, or at least recommend, using mounds of paper and folders. If you are trying to go for a paper-free office, Allen’s system will probably be of limited use to you. The sheer amount of physical material needed to pull the system off was somewhat disconcerting to me, because I generally hate to haul around and clutter my home and office with paper. However, in the final analysis, if Allen’s system actually works, I feel like the physical investment is a relatively minor thing compared with the enhanced productivity output that is possible.As an experiment, I am going to try implementing some of the system into my professional life, see how it goes, then funnel it into my personal life if I find it successful. Perhaps then I will have more insight into the usefulness of the system, and be able to provide a more practical, rather than merely abstract, review of the book. In conclusion, as someone quite cynical about self-help literature, I can honestly say I am grateful I read this book (thanks boss!).","From a Self-Help Cynic: Robust Methodology, Difficult Application","April 12, 2014",4.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFFWRTQRPS7QMNKHG3PQJMY3IAQA,Trevor Habermeyer

"Ok... the idea of ""Getting Things Done"" did, anyway.  This book itself is a little longer than it needs to be, at least for me.This book helped me realize that the main problem with my previous to-do lists was that I wasn't being specific enough about what constitutes ""done"".  As such, I couldn't ever cross anything off because my list items were evergreen things like ""improve training materials"" rather than specific ones like ""add module variables to presentation on kernel modules"".On that basis alone, the book easily returned its investment.  If you really want to employ GTD in a hyper-mobile lifestyle, however, then use an app called ""Remember The Milk"" on your phone and computer.  It's the best way I've found to put GTD into practice if your ""files"" are all electronic.","Changed my life, really","March 3, 2014",5.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHZRD7IRLLQMIYHHIVBEC5S6CVOQ,Bill Gatliff

"Of course, I purchased this book in order to get better organized. I found, though, that the author is an extremist. He is an efficiency expert.

If the child begins to cry at four minutes is there only one minute left to resolve the issue?Every item on your agenda which can be done in under two minutes, he writes, should be done immediately. There are files to keep in his own style.What I found most off-putting about the system was he recommends that you whole life be put into prioritized time-containers. He wants everything and everyone put into a box.This, then, is a very left-brained book which will suit such types who are extremely busy and regimented.

"Why did I choose this rating?I gave this book 4 stars because of it's difficulty to read. I've read the other comments and they are correct in saying that the book is not an easy read. At first, I thought it was difficult because it really rehabilitates your thought process and your unreliable personal management system. That still may be true but I thought that there were some areas that could have been explained easier.If you don't mind a book that isn't ""easy cheesy"" then this is the book for you. I wouldn't say that this book is difficult, it's just not easy. It's dry in some areas but it's well worth the purchase.This book has changed my life. I've had it for about 5 days, read the entire thing, and can really feel the changes. My productivity has increased dramatically and it feels good knowing that I am very reliable and will have the kind of personality that people can rely on. The only frustrating thing is once you change your way of thinking like the book suggest, other people that still tries to manage information on their ""failed systems"" will piss you off. For example, I've been waiting for someone to call me back with a contractor's contact info. There is no way I've would've forgot to call someone but relying on this person and their flawed management system is frustrating. No worries though, it is in on my ""next action-call's list"" to remind him tomorrow.I'd recommend this book for anyone that is serious about changing their life to being a more productive human being. It really does allow me to be stress free. When I'm living in the now, I can do just that. Since everything is in my system, it doesn't cloud my mind.

There are books that you want to read again. This will probably not be that book. It does cover the basics of time and life management. A lot of concepts in the book are repeated multiple times.The first half of the book is much more interesting than the rest half. The concept of organizing life into several layers is very interesting. He differentiates very nicely between tasks and projects and long term objectives.

"This book, of course, has become a classic in its field. And if you're interested in time management, you should get it and read it. The ideas and theory presented are great. Where it is lacking is in actually implementing the ideas in a practical way. I tried it, and like many others, got frustrated. It takes a long time to learn, and I felt like I was spending more time on the time management system than on actually working!Another author, Michael Linenberger, has taken the best of the ideas from this book and from others and built a very practical system. For an introduction, check out The One Minute To-Do List: Quickly Get Your Chaos Completely Under Control. You can get a free PDF of that book at the author's website (Google ""Michael Linenberger""). But his Magnum Opus is Total Workday Control Using Microsoft®  Outlook.

I generally fall into the trap of purchasing these types of books and don't end up implementing them: I am too disorganised to follow most systems and my work has too much urgent stuff to handle.I have found this book different. It is easy to implement: it takes a big chuck of time but I felt that I was on top of things by the time I had finished. The methods given are also forgiving in that when I have been overwhelmed I have been able to take back control. I feel more productive. My staff have also noticed the difference; my office is clean and I deal with their stuff in a much more timely manner.I don't think if I could have implemented the system using a paper based approach.

"A friend recommended this book so I took the plunge. It did inspire me to start using my legal pad lists again, but beyond that I found it impossible to finish the book because of the corporate audience its aimed at. Its full of talk about ""meetings with your investment lawyer,"" ""buying that speed boat,"" ""planning your vacation tour"" and ""your frequent trips to Japan"" etc. etc. etc. etc. If your world involves wearing a suit and tie and going to constant meetings you might like this book, but I don't live in that world and the small part of my life that dealt with that world left a really bad taste in my mouth, just being honest here. I agree with one reviewer that the book could have been 50 pages long or less and you would get the point. I got the feeling his publisher told him to write to fill up a certain amount of pages, so its alot of repetition. I'm self employed and I build things for musicians so the book didn't relate to my world at all. The final result? I now use 3 legal pads to keep track of what I need to. His organizational system is too complex for what I need so it at least made me think about doing a better job, but if you need this kind of inspiration and aren't a corporate clone living in a cubicle you might want to look for a different book, if you find one let me know.....",For the corporate suits.....,"August 27, 2013",3.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH2X2BJVBRA7ZYSE7CRLEABUHDUQ,D.

"I *can* be organized, but often find myself very unorganized.  I was afraid I was getting adult onset ADD or something, but a friend suggested I get this book and see if it helped.  Oh my gosh!  Now, I won't use words like ""miraculous"" and ""life-changing"" but it is an amazing system, described with clarity, wit and compassion.  Very hands-on and doable, this is a system you can begin to implement at once, although it takes a lot of time and effort to get it fully going.  However, the time and effort pays off big time with increased efficiency and peace of mind.  And frankly, just reading a book that acknowledges and explains the problems I've been having with organization and getting things done has been worth the cost.  Now I know that it isn't *just me* who avoids tasks that are anxiety producing or who feels worse with piles of to-do lists.

"I am very happy that I worked my way through GTD and have a system that's vastly superior to my previous one.  I think Mr. Allen's advice is excellent.I would've given the book five stars, but I dislike the organization and bloat.  It's critical to optimize the amount of information packed into a document.  GTD could've been about 150 pages without losing any information.  The writing is ""in laps.""  Mr. Allen touches upon a subject for several pages, but that subject is _really_ treated later in the book.  That's OK if the preview sections are very short.  However, they're not in GTD.  They contain almost enough to implement the method.  To be honest, I was already implementing the system after no more than 80-100 pages.  As I read the later sections, I only found a few things that needed small adjustments.  Also, there are too many asides and plugs for previous success.  Just state in the intro that the system has been very successfully used hundreds (thousands?) of times, and then save words by not repeating such info again.GTD is a pretty laborious read.

I have no doubt if one follows the advice methodically, it leads to a mind like still water.  Anyone who can follow a system like this without deviating from it very often doesn't have trouble getting things done in the first place. if paying attention and creating systems are problems to begin with, a workable system might be ten pages, or ten lines, not ten chapters.

"I searched the web for some books on productivity. I was desperate. I could not find an easily readable and affordable book. I searched again. This time one book on Amazon attracted me. It is the book I was in search of. It is 'How to Get Things Done' by David Allen. I went through some pages and ordered the book before the expected arrival date. Thank you Amazon.This is a book which you can read and implement 5S system in your home/office/company. I am new to Kaizen but I learnt many things after reading the book. The contents are very applicable if you want to achieve higher productivity. You can eliminate waste and systematize your work. Allen talks about stress free productivity in his book. His argument is that anyone can get his/her work done. Further, he believes that much of our work is complicated for we do not pay attention to such things as ergonomics and work place cleanliness. Anything that may result in waste or redundancy may be prevented if careful planning is done. Major topics in the Part 1 include:1. A New Practice for a New Reality2. Getting Control of Your Life: The Five Stages of Mastering Workflow3. Getting Projects Creatively Underway: The Five Phases of Project PlanningThese are the initial lessons you may read and get ready for the rest of the lessons. In the Part 1, you see the possibilities while in the other chapters you can taste some of the simplest things you can do to achieve higher productivity. You can easily digest the ideas as Allen's language is simple and easy to understand.The lessons, though they look simple make you reorganize your schedules and help better your understanding in areas where waste is likely to occur. I began applying simple ideas from the book and am in control of my work. He asks us to practice a little at a time and see the difference it makes. I am getting much free time now.The book is truly amazing. The book is truly thought provoking. The book is simply the best if you are into reorganizing schedules to have more free time. He says that time is money and that everyone should save time for greater enjoyment of life. He takes us to Japanese life. He gives examples from Japanese lives and advises us to practice ideas from the land of Kaizen. Kaizen ideas in this book are easy to comprehend, the language used is simple and ideas are worth practicing.`Your home is the paradise of the book worm.' said one of my students. I was puzzled to understand what the student said. It is a negative comment on how I had placed my books in my home. They were everywhere. On the dining table, in the bedroom, on chairs and even under my mattress. I was ashamed and immediately looked for a way to be organized. I am getting organized. True. I like practicing what Allen says. He changed my habits of being disorganized, not sorting things into useful and useless, and my dear friends, my home is spacious and livable now.The writer is a productivity specialist and he is a guru as well. I really like the ideas in it. Some ideas are so strong that you may implement them soon. They are eye openers and they help you better your life.Read the book. The book does not waste your time instead it helps you organize your work and save time and gives a greater sense of achievement once you begin to apply the ideas in the book. I truly enjoy organizing and making my home a place where there is less waste, things are nicely arranged, useless things are thrown away. Your friends will be amazed too.Susil Manchanayaka, B.

"David Allen's book ""Getting Things Done"" has some great ideas in it about how to get organized and become a more effective worker. I won't go into all of the reasons why this is true; there are hundreds of other reviews that explain it. The main problem with this book is that so much of it is fluff and unnecessary. Allen most likely couldn't get his book published at under 100 pages, so he stuffed it with unneeded fluff so that it would fill out an entire book. My advice is to focus on a few sections, rather than the whole book.Read:Ch. 2 (p. 24-53) - An overview of his systemCh. 4 (p. 85-103) - What you'll needCh. 5 (p. 103-118) - The ""Collection"" phaseCh. 6 (p. 119-137) - The ""Processing"" phaseCh. 7 (p. 138-180) - The ""Organizing"" phaseCh. 8 (p. 181-190) - The ""Reviewing"" phaseThe above 135 pages are what you should read.  The sections I recommend skipping are: Ch. 1, which explains why organization is important, Ch. 3, which explains the basics of brainstorming, Ch. 9, which explains the self-explanatory ""Doing"" phase, and Ch. 10-13, which just reiterates everything again.If you know which parts are useful and which are not, reading this book is a lot more enjoyable.","Great system, poor presentation","May 30, 2013",5.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEC2CYMB4MCRLAA3KC6VHK3OCFVQ,Aaa

"When thinking about it, methods to organize and structure your work are about as important as domain knowledge, or even intelligence for that matter.

The book helped me tremendously, and in combination with a paper file folder, and a digital system based on Evernote, I was able to change the way I work for the better. And David is right, it frees up your mind for other activities like reading or real thinking...I did not give a 5 star rating as the book is structured a little awkward for first time readers.

"I've been gradually switching over to the ""Getting Things Done"" (GTD) system for four months now. I've completely redone my study to work with this system. I had already figured out some of it for myself before I got the book, but there was a great deal more that really made a difference.I quickly became aware that most software that is meant to handle your to-dos is totally inadequate for use with the GTD system, so when I got a new iPod for Christmas, I bought ""Toodledo"" for my to-do management. Its entire structure is built around the GTD system. WOW! What a difference!I also bought a new front end for the ""Calendar"" that comes with the iPod. It's called ""PocketLife."" It enters all its data into the same database that the original Calendar uses, so anything entered with ""PocketLife"" also appears in ""Calendar."" It gets backed up the same way.It overcomes a weakness in the original ""Calendar."" It now allows me to enter events of the type that occur on the fourth Thursday of April, or on the first Tuesday after the first Monday of November (election day).","""Getting Things Done"" Gets Things Done","April 30, 2013",5.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEK5BTP4GF57ZXELNRYXFSR7FIYQ,R.

"I don't read a lot of books of this ilk-- but I decided to stop struggling with inventing my own personal organization system (which all failed for a variety of reasons) and just get a thorough view of one system that works for a lot of people (and was supported by the piece of software I was already using).This edition of the book (I understand there are others) was a cost-conscious purchase-- I just wanted something to Kindle and tear through in a few days.Much of the book feels like it was written about a decade-and-a-half ago-- computers exist in the world, but are not as prevalent or as reliable, making much of the practical/literal practice seem woefully out-of-date (and meaning you would have to do your own work to make the system work in the modern world-- fortunately, many people seem to have done a lot of work adapting it).Most useful, however, are the insights gleaned from the experience of getting people organized. How many tiny ""truisms"" show up in this book are what makes the difference between this being a pointlessly out-of-date user's manual for a dead technology and a timeless insight into the kinds of things that trip human beings up, regardless of the system they use.The thoughtful insights seem to be sprinkled throughout the front two-thirds of the book, and then dumped generously in the back third, in a cohesive view of why these tiny truisms make a difference and the impact they have-- in ways you can either readily understand from your own experience, or can test immediately.If you're interested in a straight-forward guidebook that you would take out to the store (to buy supplies) and then follow to the letter, I would not recommend this book (or this edition of it-- there may be a more modern one).If you're more interested in the ""failings"" of human beings as they relate to all the stuff they have to remember/do/accomplish and then see how one person solved man of those problems, I would highly recommend it.","Somewhat dated, but insightful in its understanding of the principles","April 28, 2013",4.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHKMVP52BQ6O5XO2BXH5MDSSN5UQ,Fletcher

"I challenge all the people who left a bad review to try this program - in its entirety - for two weeks and see what a difference it makes.To address a few complaints posted by other reviewers:Complaint: ""It only helps if you're already organized.""Counter argument: I'm by nature very organized, and this system has me getting more done, more quickly, with less stress, than I ever imagined possible.Complaint: ""It only helps if you AREN'T already organized.""Counter argument: If you think you're already organizezd and super productive, you wouldn't have bought this book. I challenge you to TRY the program before you knock it; reading about the program isn't enough basis for judgment. Seriously.Complaint: ""It's repetitive.""counter argument: IMO the book is repetitive because it mimics sitting down with David Allen and having him walk you through the process as though you were a client and he was sitting in your office coaching you. Some of his ideas are new and run contrary to what we've been told all our lives (e.g. we've been taught by Franklin Covey to do Daily To Do lists -- which never works -- and David explains why). It takes time to write out a cogent argument for why GTD is better in these areas.Complaint: ""It doesn't teach you how to prioritize what to do.""Counter argument: No book can teach you whether it's more important to call your kids' teacher right now, or to answer a customer service e-mail. Sounds like one of hte excuses I used when I was procrastinating and trying to justify why I wasn't getting things done. Allen puts you in the driver's seat. If you need help figuring out what's most important to do, you need more help than a book can provide.Complaint: ""It reads like an advertisement for his consulting services.""Counter argument: I've read the book three times, and I really don't get that complaint. He tells you exactly what to do, how to make the program work for you; if he was advertising his services, he'd keep some of his solutions close to the vest.Complaint: ""It doesn't motivate you do actually do the things on your list.""Counter argument: It doesn't claim to make you WANT to do your commitments. And he has a good discussion in the book of how to only put things you want to do on your list (by evaluating your long-term desires and objectives periodically).My Review:This is a great system that is revolutionary in its simplicity. It's easy to remember, easy to follow on a daily basis, and has fulfilled the goal of its title: Stress-Free Productivity.You might have to read it twice before all the pieces fit together, but isn't a system that can give you peace of mind in your work life worth that investment?",Ignore the naysayers and give this a chance,"April 16, 2013",5.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEMUX74EPV4ZGO22NF6M2Z7TXHRA,West Coast book lover

"I have been a Getting Things Done enthusiast since I first read the book close to a decade ago.  I was working in a corporate environment and successfully used this system for my work.  Then I stayed home to have kids and I just didn't have enough brain power left to figure out how GTD could work at home; babies are by nature unpredictable!  I did eventually find someone who broke it down for moms and I changed everything.  Now that I'm working from home for ACS, I find that Getting Things Done is finally fully working for me.Getting Things Done is essentially a productivity book.  I've read dozens of productivity books over the years and none of them are like this one.  The biggest difference is that it doesn't JUST tell you how to prioritize, or how to manage your email.  Instead David Allen sets up a decision-making framework for dealing with EVERYTHING that rolls around in your brain.  There is a little bit of organizational detail in dealing with your email and paper, but he describes a whole different way of thinking about your life.In the first section, he speaks to people just like you and I -- people whose responsibilities are numerous and flow over the boundaries of ""work"" and ""home"" since both can happen at anytime.  He shares an overview of both his system for all the items that we have to process in a day and his system for working on projects that require more than one step.The second part is the gem of the book.  Once he's explained an overview of the system, then he gets down to the nuts and bolts of how it works.  First, he shares how to set up your time, space and tools.  It does require some work, I won't lie.  But it is SOOOOOOOO worth the effort.  And once you set it up and get used to how it works, if you fall off the wagon it's not as big a deal.  It doesn't require quite so much time to set back up because it totally changes how you think about things-even if you are not fully utilizing it, I bet some of your processes will stay set up that way.  Ask me how I know. Ahem.  Then he shares how to corral all your stuff (collection), processing it all, and organizing it efficiently.  These are the sections that tell you how to deal with your mail, email, phone calls, etc.He goes on to talk about reviewing your system, which is a huge component that lets you keep all those balls you juggle in the air.  No other book I've ever read has talked about the importance of this.  He also talks about making the best choices (Doing) and a little more about projects.  In the last section, he discusses the importance of the collection, next-action and outcome focusing habit.  It's kind of a high-level overview of how and perhaps more importantly, WHY, you are doing all the processes he outlines in section two.Long story short, I highly recommend this book.  If you frequently find yourself forgetting things or not getting to things you want to do or even are having trouble balancing ""work"" and ""home,"" this book could change your life.  It's not just an organization, ""here's how to set up your filing system"" kind of a book.  It's more of a here's how to live life and do as much of the good stuff (Quadrant 1  for the FC fans) as possible kind of a book.  Really, really fabulous and essential for business owners who are trying to run a business, manage employees, raise kids, work on committees and just do as much as possible in a day.

"""Getting Things Done"" by David Allen is a guide to enhancing the workflow management process - those actions that are undertaken to collect, process, organize, review, and act upon open commitments that enter our lives. Many of the things that he discusses are things we already do everyday, like recording a time sensitive action into a calendar for example, but he deeply explores every aspect of a whole system that it is nearly impossible to not walk away from reading this book without identifying flaws and improving upon our own systems. He warns that a flawed system taxes our mental energies by using it for lower level thinking. ""I suggest that you use your mind to think about things, rather than think of them. You want to be adding value as you think about projects and people, not simply remind yourself they exist. To fully realize that more productive place, you will need to capture it all."" (233)The collection phase is how we capture all the ""stuff"" that we have some sense to act upon someday. Allen recommends a complete physical audit of our surroundings and mental mind sweep looking for things that are out of place or represent an open commitment that you've made to yourself. ""You need to collect and gather together placeholders for or representations of all the things you consider incomplete in your world--that is, anything personal or professional, big or little, of urgent or minor importance, that you think ought to be different than it currently is and that you have any level of internal commitment to changing."" (26)  These open commitments are agreements that we have made with ourselves at one point or another.  ""But what are all those things in your in-basket? Agreements you've made with yourself. Your negative feelings are simply the result of breaking those agreements-- they're the symptoms of disintegrated self-trust."" (227)Processing is the act of thinking about what the item is and determining whether it is an action or non-action item.  Depending on whether it is an action item or a non-action item, your left with several options as to how to later organize it. Some key rules for processing include doing the top item first, processing only one item at a time, and not allowing anything to go back into the inbox. ""When you're in processing mode, you must get into the habit of starting at one end and just cranking through items one at a time, in order. As soon as you break that rule, and process only what you feel like processing, and in whatever order, you'll invariably begin to leave things unprocessed. Then you will no longer have a functioning funnel, and it will back up all over your desk and office.""(122)The organization phase is where you place an action or non-action item within the system. ""For non-actionable items, the possible categories are trash, incubation tools, and reference storage. If no action is needed on something, you toss it, ""tickle"" it for later reassessment, or file it so you can find the material if you need to refer to it at another time. To manage actionable things, you will need a list of projects, storage or files for project plans and materials, a calendar, a list of reminders of next actions, and a list of reminders of things you're waiting for."" (Pp 35)In the review phase, it is important to cultivate a habit of reviewing your calendar and next actions list daily and doing at least a weekly review of everything else.The purpose of this workflow is to facilitate decisions that will make you more productive by doing.  Allen provides several models for making decisions about our actions. These models put our actions into context of priorities in life. ""At the end of the day, in order to feel good about what you didn't get done, you must have made some conscious decisions about your responsibilities, goals, and values. That process invariably includes an often complex interplay with the goals, values, and directions of your organization and of the other significant people in your life, and with the importance of those relationships to you."" (195)Everything discussed here so far is referred to by Allen as ""horizontal"" thinking which is the primary thrust of ""Getting Things Done"".  There were a few chapters dedicated to ""vertical"" thinking where he discusses the importance of project planning and provides some useful exercises for more introspection on life and purpose. ""Choose one project that is new or stuck or that could simply use some improvement. Think of your purpose. Think of what a successful outcome would look like: where would you be physically, financially, in terms of reputation, or whatever? Brainstorm potential steps. Organize your ideas. Decide on the next actions. Are you any clearer about where you want to go and how to get there?"" (59)""Getting Things Done"" is a systematic approach to handling that daily minutia that occupies our minds. The system allows you to capture everything and review it on your own terms rather than allowing it to command your attention.  Overall, it is about installing ""tricks"" in one's life to be highly productive.  ""To a great degree, the highest performing people I know are those who have installed the best tricks in their lives. I know that's true of me. The smart part of us sets up things for us to do that the not-so-smart part responds to almost automatically, creating behavior that produces high-performance results. We trick ourselves into doing what we ought to be doing.""(85)",Getting Ish Done,"February 11, 2013",5.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEQBAWD3M7RV5TGGRPSP6R5A75IQ,John

"One of those books that changes your life, especially if you're Type A, a procrastinator, or a worrier. The methods described in the book are a bit outdated, especially for the younger crowd, but the principles are solid gold.Being a hardcore productivity nerd, I've found this to be the best book on the subject. In short, the GTD philosophy is this: your brain is a terrible place to keep things you need to do. If you remember them at all, you'll remember them in the wrong place. For example, you remember that the flashlight needs new batteries when you pick up the dead flashlight, not when you're at Walmart and could buy them. Your brain becomes very stressed out by knowing you have things to do, so it's actively trying to remember all of them all the time, not just when you need the information. (Why this philosophy is great for people who worry or are anxious!) The idea is that you need to get everything out of your head and written down in a system you trust; one you will review regularly and be able to trust it won't lose the information (or make it hard to find). That's it.Personally, I implement the system with a physical inbox at home and at work, Remember the Milk for lists accessible on all my devices, and Google Calendar for appointments. I'm currently experimenting with using Wunderlist to gather my ""keep in mind"" lists, such as a bucket list and writing topics. The initial purge of information from my brain was one of the best feelings ever. I sat down and just wrote pages and pages of things that needed to be done.Read reviews of GTD methods and see what you think would work best for you, then try a couple of them. For ideas on how to implement GTD, the blog Lifehacker is a great resource, both for reviews of tools for the system (such as RTM, Producteev, Orchestra, Wunderlist, etc) and little things to make those tasks easier.

"I am a diagnosed ADD/OCD.  I've tried a lot of things to get through life.  A few things work, that is, to some extent.  I'm not a big fan of self help books, but when I saw this book mentioned in the Atlantic by James Fallows, a respected writer, I thought I'd take a look.  To describe this system of Getting Things done in a few words, I'd say it's system to get all the things you must worry about, think about, plan for, etc., out of your mind, conscious and subconscious, and get them written down in an orderly manner so they will be dealt with on time and in an orderly manner (and so that you will not forget them).  The big secret is this:  if everything is organized and recorded safely so you need not worry about overlooking or forgetting something, you don't worry about anything other than what's in front of you, and you get that done.  Tall order, but it works, and I'd say for a lot, if not most, people.  It's well worth trying even if you ony partially implement it.The clincher for me was that, out the outset, he described my mind to a T, always crammed with must do's, like to do's, and surprises.  And I found, to my surprise, that I have used some of his techniques myself in trying to cope wiht ADD and trying to keep sane.  I came up with them on my own trying to deal with my ADD.  I was so impressed with the book that I'm trying to implement the entire system, and it seems to be working.If you've got more than you can handle, and if you can't focus on one thing because you're worrying about 20 others, give this book a read.  It's an easy read, but he's a little repetitive and verbose at times.

"First, let me say that implementing the GTD system has made a profound impact on my professional and personal life. Seriously, while much of this book seems almost common sense, having it illustrated in this way will help you to see the light. You've got more going on than you realize.Now, why is the book repetative? I, like many of the 1-star reviewers here noticed this right away -- the flowchart is in three different places, and many of the points are repeated...over and over and over again. This put me off at first, but after going through it, and reading it a second time, and a third, I believe I may have found the reasoning:He's drilling it into you. The thing with this system, the fundamental chunk is that you need to be absolutely and completely confident in the system. It begins to fall apart (as he mentions) if it's implementation is half-assed or the user is not completely confident in its purpose. He repeats things so that you will remember them. It makes for a boring read, but read it again, see the style, accept it for what it is, and give it a go.As an Art Director, I juggle a ton of projects all the time. Personally, I prefer notes on paper; and while I've already configured Outlook to be as GTD-friendly as it gets, I'm working on personal, custom (and I like to think aesthetically pleasing) GTD-optimized Arc/Circa pages. I'm hoping to bypass many of the details memorization and learn by doing -- by having cheat sheets and optimal formatting on my own planning pages.Bottom line, you'll benefit from this book in ways that your standard-issue high school planner simply and utterly failed to do.

"I searched for this book because I was in a situation of stress and low productivity. Before knowing about GTD, I started to write down little to-do's lists to help me focus and organize my life (basically related to day job and my master dissertation). It created a kind of ""light-at the-end-of-the-tunnel-feeling"", but I still couldn't decide what to do first, and I still didn't have a full grasp of everything. Reading David Allen's formula for productivity changed my way of thinking and  handling all life activities.The book is very descriptive, a true step-by-step guide that we can immediately apply. It's detailed, with examples and great discussions.Highly recommended for anyone who wish to have a upgrade of life organization and productivity!",Life changing organization,"October 9, 2012",5.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFP4MRLOUUZ57MVKCVCA2K7A4KNA,Ariadne MM
"This book has been a real influencer for me.  Allen presents a great system for getting both work and personal affairs in excellent order, which could transform any area of work or life which features discretionary time.  Its popularity is not surprising, and it should not just be considered for business executives.The best thing about Allen's system is that it does not oversimplify the problem.  Advice to schedule work has lost applicability for most of us, simply because we are getting such a huge number of options about how best to spend our minutes and hours.  The increased complication does not jive well with set schedules.  Even so, people need to be able to act rationally, easily and rapidly with any amount of time they happen to have at hand.  That is what Allen is working to address, and he deserves tremendous credit for his effort.While I'm giving the book five stars, as a homemaker I think I have a good opportunity to write a bit about how the book does, and does not, apply to my situation.  Most of my day is not taken up by novel projects, but by repeating tasks that I know very well how to do.  I don't have to think them through very much.  Even so, set schedules don't work well for me since housekeeping needs are just as variable as office tasks.  I adapt Allen's system by putting my familiar tasks on index cards and dealing out the jobs I need to do at the start of the day.Now Allen is not keen on to-do lists because they are easily upended by the rapid pace of life.  He has a point, but this doesn't take into account the motivating force of a good daily list.  I have five small kids who are quite distracting, yet I still find that a list of items, kept realistic for the day's circumstances, is helpful in getting more done in my life.The book generally implies that it is normal to have a massive list of things to do, with new jobs being added consistently.  I have not seen the concrete situations Allen is talking about, but it seems important to consider, if only briefly, the reality of overwork.  Excessive work is going to stress anyone, even with a great system.  Tasks that go beyond a person's reasonable load need to be either delegated or clearly possible to drop with acceptable consequences.  The ""defer"" category works great for future possibilities, but is trickier to use with still-open loops, especially where responsibilities have been accepted.Allen's ""50 thousand foot"" perspective is largely relativistic.  There is another way to think about that level of living, and that is the Christian idea of vocation.  Allen doesn't really contradict this, but neither does he fully acknowledge it as a discrete means of thinking about life at this level.  The thinking he describes is more about ""personal choices"", ""clarified values"" and ""lifestyle"".  Vocation-oriented thinking focuses more on universal moral principles and the will of God for one's individual life.  Allen doesn't need to advocate this idea of vocation, but to acknowledge it would make the book more helpful and complete.Just considering the issue that Allen addresses, that of systemizing all the ideas, needs and physical items of life, makes me reflect (as does the author himself) that the book is really about life at its core.  It's not just about being neat or working well at the office, it's about getting ones self into a place where any change, task or project can be addressed in a more successful way.  So I would recommend it to anyone as a fundamental preliminary support for the events of life, from weight loss to finding a spouse.

"I think it's fair to say that I'm a pretty busy guy most of the time. That is why I picked up this book, to find some ways in which I could maybe find a few things to tweak my currently existing productivity plans.  I was somewhat distraught when I found out, that in order to follow David Allen's plan, I would have to throw away the other ways that I do things.In part, I think this is why David Allen's system gains so many followers, it is a fairly simple way for people to experience the disruption of their current methods of productivity and adopt new ones.  As has been shown in other places, the simple act of adjusting to a new system often maximizes some dormant energy that has been lurking around in your old method.Looking at the tools suggested for use in Allen's system, paper notes to yourself, physical inboxes, file folders - you can see that Allen's system is heavy on the ""feel good"" of seeing immediate gratification from your work, i.e. throwing a note to self about a task in the trash.All in all, I was able to gain some helpful ideas from Allen's book here and there, and will be considering if I can adopt Allen's system in toto, or if that's even the best move for me.  Lastly, although the book is short and is a relatively quick read - it's not an entirely enjoyable read, filled by conjecture and hypotheticals.  I did however find the ""aw shucks"" psychology intriguing as I many times found myself saying ""well, that makes sense to the way that I think about work...""I'd recommend this book to someone who is looking for a completely new system or method of productivity, especially someone whose work is largely based around new projects (not necessarily recurring projects).",Ok if you need a brand new system or methodology,"September 15, 2012",3.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGPZGK56JWICW3O2R3ID5DVAR75Q,jwinterscom

"Imagine the most organized person you know.  They don't lose important information, they turn their work in on time (or early) and they get the right things done on a day in and day out basis.  Now imagine that person learned all these habits from one person.  That one person would be David Allen.In Getting Things Done David Allen has devised a full-proof system that will organize all the information in your life, help you put it in the right ""bucket"", get the right things done at the right time and make sure that the process is self-sustaining and reinforcing.  All in 259 pages.If you struggle with getting things done, keeping track of wave after wave of information crossing your desk or completing projects on time and don't see an end in sight, this book can change your life.The beauty of Getting Things Done is the system makes intuitive sense and if you really want to change, if you've reached the point where keeping on top of tasks, to-do lists and projects is like drinking water out of a fire hydrant this book can help.  It can make all the difference, but you have to change first.I first started reading the book in 2008, but I wasn't ready to change.  I picked it up again last year and what I had thought dry and boring before spoke to me in a new clear and instructive way.  In my case I was finally ready.  If you think you might want to change I would discourage you from reading this book.  If you know you are ready to change your organization habits I urge you to read this book ASAP.My Top Three Takeaways:Get everything in one place""Anything you consider unfinished in any way must be captured in a trusted system outside your mind, or what I call a collection bucket, that you know you'll come back to regularly and sort through.""  For me this was the most important lesson from the book.  Only when we are sure that everything is in the right bucket can we relax and let go of that nagging fear that something somewhere has been lost or forgotten.  Once we do that we can let the system and the steps that make up the system do their thing and we can focus on the business of getting those things done.Next-ActionsAllen makes clear that there are separate steps for material that is not actionable, but if something is actionable and isn't part of an ongoing project you can ""Do It"" (if it will take less than 2 minutes), you can ""Delegate It"" or you can ""Defer It"".How much more could you get done if you made this process part of your DNA?  Try it for a day and see how it feels.  I think you'll see how powerful this is.Two Don'ts - no ""to file"" folders and no tasks on calendar that won't get doneFirst, Allen says don't ever have a ""to-file"" folder.  For that matter I would argue don't have a ""to-read"" folder.  Neither will happen.  Deep down inside you know it's true, so don't do it.Second, if it goes on your calendar Allen says the only reason it doesn't get done is if it was an appointment that got moved or canceled.  Other than that if it is on your calendar you must complete it that day.  These habits not only build trust with others that you get things done, but more importantly it builds trust with yourself that you can set goals and do them.ConclusionI can't emphasize enough that Allen's system will work.  However, you have to change your behavior and live the systems he lays out.  And for all the great ideas and tips that he describes they will all be useless unless you commit to making the first change.There is quote that says a man who doesn't read has no advantages over a man who can't read.  In the case of Getting Things Done the person who reads it and doesn't want to change has no advantage over someone who never even heard of the book.

"""Getting Things Done"" is a book that really made a difference to me.  It made me realize some of the areas where I have not been in control of my own life as I should.  There is a section that I especially liked about not feeling guilty when you aren't getting something done.  The author made me realize that I was only hurting myself and not helping my productivity at all with worry and regret over what ""could have"" or ""should have"" been accomplished.  After gaining so much from this book, I also read Time Control - Taking Control and Achieving Goals (Creating Lifestyle) written by Martin Gover.  It is also a great book and explains well how to manage your lifestyle to be successful.

"I bought this book after hearing Mr. Allen on NPR.  I liked what he was saying about getting my ways of dealing with all the things to be done organized into a big workflow.  I intuitively grasped where he was leading me and wanted to get the full descriptions by reading the book.  Unfortunately his written descriptions are pretty bad.  The layout of the book is ok, but the structure of the writing is bad.  If I had not heard the radio descriptions from him I am not sure I would have grasped why his method is the way it is.  I may have grasped the method, but with just that I am just a trained monkey.  I  am engineer and I could have communicated the same info in about half to three quarters of the pages, so the book is a disappointment.",Great Concept Murdered by the Writing,"August 16, 2012",3.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEQVIB7D47WZDJ7LJNN4FGE6XOIA,Rocket Scientist

"I just started to get into the GTD world this past weekend. I have heard about GTD but never really looked into it. I was recently promoted to a manager role and found my head was just filled with non-stop thoughts. I dropped several tasks and had a hard time remembering where projects were at, when it was just me I could manage it in my head. It was hard but doable. Now I have a team of 4 people plus myself I'm responsible for so my old system which barely worked, now isn't working. I decided GTD is a worldwide phenomenon  there has to be something to it, so I ran down to my local book store (who know they still existed) and bought the only copy of this book they had. I sat down at noon and 2 hours later I was half way through the book. I was so into it that I stopped when I got to the ""here's what you need to get started"" and drove to the office supply store and bought the items recommended, a labeler, desktop in boxes, etc. I headed home and finished the book. I immediately started doing the dump first emptying my work bag of all notes, I started writing everything I ""had to do"" that I was keeping track of in my head and once I had it out I felt good. It was a sigh of relief knowing I now had lists of what i needed to do and at any time I could look to see what I could work on depending on where I was (context) and how much time I had.Is GTD a end all solution to stress? I'm not sure. For me there is a little bit of stress introducing a system into my life. But seeing how I had no real system before I figure it's worth a shot.So I went to work this morning with my supplies and setup my desk, built the tickler folder system and started filing things laying around (after loading up my in box.). I emptied my drawers and eliminated over 200 feet of network cables I was hoarding, cables, power strips, blank DVDs (and I no longer even have a dvd burner go figure.). I left the office today with stuff still in my in box but my desk is clean and tomorrow my goal is to finish running through the inbox process.This is a good book, the system seems to be simple although parts seem to be overly complex. I had to re-read a few sections a few times to really understand them but once I did it made sense to me.I would recommend if you were like me and had no system but a head full of ""stuff"" then you get this. You have nothing to lose by trying this. I'll try to update you with how this works for me but so far I do feel a bit of relief in knowing what I need to do and not having to worry about things because every task is being written down and logged for me to do when and where I can get it done.","Trying to jump on the GTD Band Wagon, So far it feels pretty good","May 21, 2012",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFZIG5OC2VWCLRU6XDEBL63KCZMA,Jeremy Haggard

"This is the bible when it comes to organizing yourself.After reading this book, I find myself with a clean desk, a pieceful mind and in control of the things that really matter. The nice thing about the method is that it does not rely on high-tech software and gadgets, though they can help. Good writing gear and a pile of paper, and a few plain manila folders is all you need to get started. You can tailor it to your own setting and to the tools you like (e.g., I like emacs and org-mode).The book is a bit lengthy, but well structured, so that you get the gist of the presented methodology after a few tens of pages.

"David Allen offers a strikingly simple, yet powerful, method for staying on top of life. Defining productivity as the intersection between action and vision, he offers a set of practical methods to reach that intersecting point:1. Trust an external system to make you think about the activities only when you need to (calendar, action piles, and to-do lists or tickler files)2. Maintain the discipline to keep the external tool accurate or else you will not rely on it3. Regularly review your activities (weekly review)4. Make decisions about every action (do the work now, defer the work, or evaluate work)5. Do work that is most suited to the moment given the following factors: time, energy, location, and priority6. Always evaluate work within its broader perspective. An individual task should map roughly to a project, goal, and ultimately, life objective7. As ""what's the next action?"" to everything that you must manage8. Think positively about your ability and encourage that in othersOverall, Allen's method promotes and encourages a high degree of focus in all of life, both professionally and personally.My only complaint with ""Getting Things Done"" is its verbosity. Allen is highly repetitive, often devoting later chapters to topics he covered in earlier chapters.

"Reading this book brought me contradictory feelings. Although it does tell you one interesting thing here and there that will be of help in your daily routine, most of it is composed by useless, obvious and systematically repeated ideas that bring you to the point of irritation. Most of the times, I felt like the book should be retitled to ""Getting Things Said and Repeated: The Art of 'Stress-Full' Book Writing"".A few concepts in the book indeed helped me, even though some of them are incomplete or inadequate in certain situations. The 2-minute rule is surely helpful. However, not putting it in a priority context can be misleading. Compound the effect of 15 to 20 ""2-minutes-tasks"" (something very common to any busy working person) and you'll have lost 30 minutes of your day, instead of spending them in projects that are indeed more urgent and important.The other concepts that are somewhat useful are the focus on the outcome and next action for each task, although David Allen is definitely not the 1st person to write about it. The 4-factor model to choosing activities is also useful, but kind of obvious to anyone who already has a pretty busy agenda. Still, the way David Allen formalizes it is nice.Now let's go to the bad things.First, the author repeats and repeats himsef, over and over again. And it's more than that usual mistake of such books, which simply repeat stuff in different ways. Actually, while most readers don't enjoy such approach, I usually find it useful, as typically I'm reading the book along a few different days and repetition helps me to fix the most important ideas in long-term memory. But David Allen is not repeating himself in different ways, he repeats WHOLE SENTENCES throughout the book. I mean it!Secondly, some of his descriptions are much more detailed than they should. He spends a long time writing about things like useless details about how your file drawer should be. Come on.In addition, and most important, his system as a whole is too complex and time-consuming. It gets me stressed only by reading about it, let alone implementing it. The author itself admits how many hours per week the maintenance of the system consumes, and how it's easy to fall trap to habits that will make the system get wrecked. I guess that if the person has the organization qualities to implement this stuff, probably he already has a system of his own that works fine. People who are reading this book are probably doing so because they're searching for a simple way to put their work and personal life on foot. And this method definitely doesn't deliver it.Despite the terrible title and cover (especially the cover!), I bought the book because of all the rave reviews on Amazon and Goodreads. But I must say I felt cheated. It feels like there's a lot of hype about this book, more than it should. Overall, I'm not giving it a 1-star rating because of the 3 useful things I mentioned above. So maybe those or others can be of help to you too. But if you decide to read the book, beware. It can be a ""stress-full"" experience.","Complex and ""stress-full"" system","April 1, 2012",2.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AE5UKJEYFAAZFUL2WBIDB5RZTNZQ,Marcelo Bahia
"1. GATHER: Walk around your office or home starting at your desk and gather any undone thing (or a note of that undone thing) and put in your in box. EVERYTHING. Business cards, get toilet paper, dinner reservations.2. SORT: Put each item in a category> HOME (think 'do this when I'm home tinkering'), PHONE, ERRANDS, COMPUTER, READ, PEOPLE (think 'the next time I talk to this person I want to remember to tell them this') WAITING (think 'well I called that person or delegated this thing and now I'm waiting to hear back from them so here is a note to not forget about that thing out there) and then add whatever categories you think you need.3. ACT NATURAL: Whenever you are running errands, look at your ERRANDS and you wont forget batteries for the smoke detector or to pick up that thing from the post office when you drove right past it.

"Very interesting set of ideas. The most useful analogy is to your computer RAM, the active front burner memory whose unoccupied space dictates how well and fast you are able to process and manipulate information. The author contends that a clean RAM is best for being able to do your best work. How do you get a clean RAM? You must have a system to catalogue all of the ""stuff"" that comes at you like drinking from a firehose. The author goes to great detail describing a complex method that creates a system to capture and catalogue everything you can think of or even image. I think the basic premise ""ie a clean RAM"" is a very useful idea that until you work with it you do not appreciate the power contained in this simple concept.

"I am a recovering workaholic - it turns out that being addicted to work-ahol is just as detrimental and horrible as being addicted to actual substances. Anyway, part of my self-imposed and managed ""rehab"" is dealing with the piles and messes that my inability to say ""no"" has created in my office. I first got this book on audible and listened to it on a few long drives I had to do for work. I was floored from the first five minutes I listened to it - some reviewers mention that the book is repetitive or otherwise fluffed, but I really benefited from all of it. I kept thinking it was crazy that the author was talking to me about me, and related to it all too well.The solutions are simple - almost so simple you feel like an idiot for not just knowing these things. But it has been a life saver for me. I spent about a week putting these techniques into practice (just the simple concept of making a decision with everything you touch from your ""In"" basket was novel to me - I'm a chronic piler and re-piler, which is very self-defeating and inefficient, it turns out). I have to say, everyone at work just about has a heart attack every time they walk by my office and see the sparkling organization system, or when I have a meeting with someone and have all the items I need to give them easily accessible in my (oh so easy and obvious) filing system - and when I get them a piece of information I've been sitting on for months because I didn't know where something was or it wasn't an emergency thing with a hard deadline.Yeah, so you should get this book. I am so glad I did. I got the paperback after listening to the audible version about 3 times (and have listened to it again several more times while driving around town). I hear and read new things every time I go through it and it is truly invaluable to me. I am so glad I got it.

"Keywords: Organization; Time management; Prioritization; Task managementThis book is built around a few key ideas for organizing one's thoughts and a simple system for organizing one's papers and tasks.One key idea states that the effort needed to remember and prioritize our task lists takes away from our ability to perform those tasks. Therefore, Mr. Allen recommends writing down everything so as to clear our minds for focused concentration. Of course, other authors have recommended keeping notes, but he makes it clear why this action is vital to success.Unlike other books on this subject that are full of ""drink the Kool-Aid"" jargon and are designed to sell a product line, Mr. Allen's system can be created and used by anyone without any special tools.Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity","Simple, yet powerful system","February 6, 2012",4.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEX4HAKEE3UBSYLK4RMWZ2H7Y5SQ,T

Better yet, go to the 43 Folders site and since they pretty much STOLE all of that system and claimed it as their own, you can get it for FREE there. And if you are unfortunate enough to get  duped into one of their $750 training, DO NOT buy any of their crap they are selling! First of all, their trainers were not very good, boring, and if I heard ""Turn to your neighbor next to you"" one more time as an ""Activity"" I was going to get up and leave. Within one hour of this garbage, ALL of the people around me were mocking ""the system"" and the boring trainer who was trying hard to sell it as something worthwile. What a joke. Then they tried to sell a bunch of David Allen crap to us that was just as much over priced garbage as their training. I am NOT KIDDING when I tell you that I saw the EXACT SAME bag at BIG LOTS for ONE DOLLAR as they were trying to schlep on us for $19.95. REALLY? By the time the long day was over, I was so mad about spending the money and getting nothing for it as well as seeing a big advertisement for me to buy more of their crap. David Allen, you should be ashamed of yourself trying to sell yourself as as real ""system"" that won't work for 95% of the working population, and then try selling YOUR NAME on crap. Anyone who has had the misfortune of sitting through your horrible training should not only get their money back, but also get paid for their time they wasted sitting in front of your horrible trainers.

"I have listened to the audio version from our local library. The most difficult part in applying Mr Allen`s system is the lack of defining a single system that effectively bridges the transition between the last century ( physical memos, mail, papers ... etc) and the recent electronic revolution in communications ( emails, pdf files of scanned letters, smart phone , PDA`s and even computers and the hundreds of organizing software out there).  He mentions all the possible input devices and electronic systems but still has physical tickler files and folders as primary tools of organization.  The major difficulty i face the last 10 years is the mashed worlds of both physical and electronic systems, i can`t get a handle on either or combine both, do I scan every paper that is important for a project and drop it the organizer software folder? or i print it and insert it in the tickler file ? If i utilize the physical and electronic, the system will fail, surely it will confilc with basic principle of organization ( have one system).  I still don`t have a single system that works in both.  Unfortunately Mr Allen didn`t answer this question and may have even made it more complicated by giving you the options to use either and showing you how to use only one or part of it, in the real world, we don`t have that option.

But over the last 18 months or so a certain malaise had crept into my productivity which drained my energy and left me feeling overwhelmed and very ineffective.

Second, there was quite a bit of repetition in the book.

"This book reads more like a sales pitch than a guide to getting organized.  Online resources actually explain Allen's concept far better than he does, because he's too busy trying to be cute and clever, to express his ideas succinctly.  One gets the distinct feeling that his concept could have been explained in a booklet, but he felt the need to pad it out into a full-length book, just to land a book contract.Worse, his method often involves handling paperwork over and over again.  For example, during the initial purging of unnecessary papers, he suggests creating an inbox in which to keep the remaining papers, until they can be processed again, and filed in the appropriate folders.  It would make more sense just to file those papers during the first sorting, rather than handling the same papers twice!  This is just one of his many truly stupid ideas that waste valuable time.Organizing systems like 43 folders are far more sensible.

"GTD or 'Getting Things Done' is all about personal productivity, gaining control over your life and reducing stress.It's NO classical time management. It's NO project management and it does not tell you HOW to optimally achieve a goal.Whereas classical time and project management is all about PLANNING, GTD is about ADAPTING. Therefore, it is well suited for managing everyday tasks and duties.The key principles:1. Get everything OUT of your head and into an EXTERNAL MEMORY2. Register information in ACTIONABLE form3. Organize your tasks by the limiting factor and let the decision on which task to perform next, FIRST depend on CONTEXT (NOT on priority!). In other words: you work in blocks of time and during each block, you do similar things.Important side effects of GTD:- You are more PRESENT in the moment- TRUST and COOPERATION within groups improvesGTD distinguish 5 stages: collect, process, organize, review, do.I think GTD is helpful. However, do also read Covey's 7 Habits. Whereas Allen is the expert in productivity, Covey is the expert in effectiveness. One needs both in life.

The result for me was a series of understandings:  why I had trouble finding starting points; why I was always reactive and not proactive, and why I was always overcommitted.Two months ago, I was finally frustrated enough with my A B C priority system that I started looking around for better software. I began to see references to GTD and as I researched further it sounded as though David Allen had the solution. It is the kind of read I expected a life-changing book to be.  Looking back, I agree that there are only a few dozen main points to come away with, but Allen introduces them directly and reinforces them anecdotally, metaphorically and with memorable quotes and quips.  My sole complaint is that the kindle version has several formatting issues, but the resulting non sequiturs forced me to reread some very important subjects. Finally, having read Laikin's ""Time And Your Life"" book in the '80s, Allen fit many pieces together for me.If you're serious about getting the upper hand over the steady stream of stuff flooding your desk from every direction, invest the time into reading this book properly.

"OK, so when an associate of mine told me that this was the most influential book he'd ever read on organisational skills and that the book, and the system, had changed his life, I was reluctant to believe him.  I decided, just to prove him wrong, that I'd grab a copy and see what all the fuss was about.I read it in 2 sittings, commenced implementing it immediately, and after a week I realised that I too had found the best organisational system that I'd ever come across - and that is saying something!  I've been in the business community for more than 20 years, have worked for international consulting firms, been to more training courses on the use of management systems, owned every PDA, manual time system and document tracking system known to man, bought every Ipad App available, but this one system has without doubt, absolutely and totally changed my life.  And for life it is!There is a massive adjustment.  I worked out that my supposed ""Stress free"" paperless office was in fact causing me more stress than I had ever realised.  I can now locate any document that I need literally within seconds and my staff think I'm taking some super drug because my office now looks like something out of an IKEA magazine and what's best, this all came for the very small price of the book along with a few dollars for the accompanying iPhone App.  The Outlook App too is less than $100 but it works best for me on my phone.  Everyone will use it differently, but the use of it is what is SO enjoyable.It isn't a system, it's a life choice......for everyone from receptionists to super execs and everyone in between, if you follow David's rules, you too will reduce your stress enormously and be the super organised person you always dreamt of!  I just wish I'd invented the system and been using it for the past 20 years!Without doubt, anyone who reads this book will have implemented bits and pieces of David's super wisdom in their lives - it's the combination and then the reviews of these systems that create the power behind what he writes.I love it - I never thought I'd love an organisational system, but I do and if I met him, I'd tell David I love him too!Don't miss up the opportunity to give it a go and feel the LOVE!",DO NOT PASS UP THIS BOOK AT ANY COST!,"July 14, 2011",5.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGM4DZCPHZFTPOHNFDI7XUZOMZLQ,Amanda Mason

"One way that I judge a book is by how much impact it really has on my career and life after I finish reading it.

This way you can listen to certain sections multiple times at your pace.A few major impacts that this book had on my career include:- I implemented David's filing system for ""loose"" papers and now my office desk is clean (most of the time)- My to-do list is much more effective based on David's recommendations of how to layout your list- I now manage my e-mails rather than letting them manage me (this is a big one)Most importantly all of these items allow me to lead a less stressful life.Thank You David!I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking to not only get organized but to reduce stress and improve their time management skills.",This Book Will Help You Get Organized and Reduce Stress in A Big Way,"June 28, 2011",5.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGWUDHACTBD7SPED6RGU25AXH7LQ,Anthony Fasano
"“Getting Things Done” is an excellent selfmanagement book, written by David Allen, a wellknown productivity expert and thinker, who takes in this book the productivity to another level.The author, also known as “the productivity guru”, describes throughout the book a structured process for managing time and work effectively and efficiently. The reader is guided on how to capture, process and carry out open loops, TODOs, project tasks etc., in a productive and stressfree manner.The entire book is framed around the five stages on managing workflow:- Collecting information, TODOs and work items- Processing the collected items- Organizing the items in actionable and noactionable items, setting up project lists, etc.- Reviewing the items regularly- Doing the actual work by carrying out the collected itemsIn a nutshell the general message of the book is to empty our head of information, by writing down TODOs, ideas and thoughts, which we plan to address sometime in the future. Once we’ve captured these open loops we sort them out, make them actionable (where applicable), decide on the next actions and ultimately get the things done.Personally I liked and already applied several times the “2 minutes” rule. According to this rule, when we organize and process our workflow, the items that take less than 2 minutes we’ll do them right away. The items that take longer than 2 minutes we’ll defer for later or delegate. By following this rule I can get rid quite fast of those items which are piling up and unnecessarily waiting for me or threatening me to allocate time and attention for them.Another thing I found really useful is the power of the “nextaction” decision, which in fact is an active approach that I personally use since years. Making things actionable and ensuring that no decision is left suspended without a concrete nextaction, is something that brings traction and pushes things ahead.Although “Getting Things Done” was written many years ago, the productivity guidelines are still well applicable today. On the other hand, the collecting tools described in the book, such as file folders, paper trays etc. can be replaced nowadays with “electronic” collecting systems, such as client, web or mobile workflow management apps.",Boost your productivity with Getting Things Done,"June 26, 2011",4.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGSZFE3J5STW7I5PVMGNRCAX2RPA,Marian Haus

"Despite reading many books on organization, time-management, etc., I had yet to find a methodology that really worked for a scatterbrain like myself. Franklin Covey's 7 Habits was overbearing, and required too much ""stuff."" The concept that I had to plan my day down to the minute was crazy, and have not met anyone who does this effectively. Other books, such as Time Management for Dummies, First Things First, and The Four Hour Workweek all required simultaneous habit changes in order to be effective. Being a scatterbrain, requiring more than one habit change at a time was simply asking way too much -- it was downright absurd. Furthermore, some of the suggestions made in these books were wishful thinking, as in the case of The Four Hour Workweek which advised hiring a secretary in India to do most of your work for you (HA! Do they do homework too?). Even more implausible, the author suggested starting an online business to automate revenue, which sounds good in theory; too bad his example was selling french style striped T-shirts.I had given up on these self-help books years ago, and rightly so IMHO. Then things started happening which forced me analyze how I manage my to-do lists (or rather, did not manage them). School was getting harder, chores were neglected, phone calls were missed, and I was always exhausted. To boot, we're looking to move out of the country, sell our house and everything in it, planning a going away party, planning trips to see family, and I'm trying to study for the MCATs. So, I broke down and bought Getting Things Done by David Allen.Finally I discovered a book which not only ""get's it,"" but also understands how to, no pun intended, get things done! Instead of fighting my habits, this book is showing me how to benefit from them. GTD doesn't require anyone to change their entire life in order to become more organized like so many other books -- which claim anyone can be more organized by simply changing everything about themselves. GTD is not full of the same suggestions over and over, such as breaking bigger projects into smaller pieces (duh), or incentivizing (when you finish this task, you can have a whole gallon of ice cream!). Rather, GTD outlines a method which is completely compatible for those of us who really need a book on organization, time-management, and completing the items on an ever growing to-do list. GTD understands it's readership and offers valuable tips and tricks which, almost magically, make someone more organized. As the author puts it, ""we trick ourselves everyday, like putting important documents next to the door the night before we need to take them with us."" The strategies suggested in this book are so simple, even I can do them (which is saying a lot).Suffice to say, GTD is the best book on organization I have ever read (and I've read a lot of these types of books!). It's easy to read, easy to implement, and does not make you feel bad about yourself. A great find, a great book, and a great addition to my library.

"David Allen's book Getting Things Done is one of the most popular books written on Time Management. I had very high expectations when I started reading.Getting things doneIt is a very complicated explanation of a simple and effective system.The system David has created is very effective and I have in fact incorporated it to my own time management system.The problem with it is that it doesn't capture activities you have to do every day, it is build around projects, ideas and unexpected events.InboxThe idea is that you have an inbox to capture everything that comes to you.Every day you should process your inbox and either file the information as reference material, add it to your calendar, put it on a to-do list or just do it at once.The methodology is very simple and efficient.What takes time is building an effective filing system and to make sure you get reminded of all the actions you need to do when you need to do them.3 Parts of the bookDavid has split the book into three distinct parts.The first third of the book is useless; It is an introduction to the system, without really explaining it, which leaves you as a reader, very, very confused.The third part is unnecessary since it discuss goal setting without any details and the value of the system, basically he is just trying to get us to use the information in the middle;which is very useful.The Second part is very goodThe middle of the book covers the system in detail and shares all the information needed to make it efficient.Works great with a weekly planIf you use his system together with a weekly plan and with a Calendar it will capture all your commitments and make you very efficient.Time Management can save you up to 2000 hours/yearBy learning proper time management you can save lots of time, energy and reduce your stress levels.

"Getting Things Done by David Allen is perhaps the most left-brained book I've ever read. List making and to-do tracking doesn't exactly make for a thrilling read. And yet, this is an important and forever practical book IF you put into practice the core of what Allen is saying. I'm a daily list maker and I live by my calendar. I never read a book on personal organization though I've invested much of my adult life in it.Here are the most important points of the book, in my opinion: (1) Get all your to-do's (All. Of. Them.) out of your head and write them down. This will free your mind from having to think about them incessantly. (2) Give all of your immediate to-do's a next action. (For example, ""get a dental check-up"" should instead be ""call and make a dental appointment."") If you can't do the next action at any given time, then transfer it to a separate list to be reviewed sometime later. (3) Don't worry about the what tools to use to organize your life. Start simple with a paper, pen and perhaps a folder and grow from there. Most complex organizational tools are probably too specifically customized for what you need anyway. And (4), every single one of your to-do's is an arranged agreement with yourself. If you put it off or forget about it, you feel the guilt in your mind consciously or not. Having them written down helps your meet your own commitments as well as saying no to commitments you now know you can't keep.There's many more steps to keeping your personal organization optimized than the above points (for example, defining separate lists such as the ""tickler"" and the ""someday/maybe""), but those I feel are the most crucial. Doing boring stuff like what Getting Things Done advocates would seem soul-sucking to a more right-brained type, but I firmly believe creativity is at its best when it is organized.","Worth reading, but not an easy read","April 18, 2011",4.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH63KJZUAEPZIGSYC6OXAXZJD3HQ,Daniel Estes
"As the title indicates this is a book about re-gaining control of one's life through high-performance workflow management. There are two key objectives upon which this is based: ""(1) capture all the things that need to get done - now, later, someday, big, little, or in between - into a logical and trusted system outside of your head and off your mind; and (2) disciplining yourself to make front-end decisions about all of the ""inputs"" you let into your life that you will always have a plan for ""next actions"" that you can implement or renegotiate at any moment.""The author then goes one to describe the five stages of mastering workflow:(1) ""collect things that command our attention""(2) ""processs what they mean and what to do about them""(3)""organize the results, which we""(4)""review as options for what we choose to""(5)""do""The above seems rather straightforward and we all perform the above steps in some way shape or form. The key here is to perform all these steps consistently and with the same standard. After all the workflow is only as efficient as the weakest of the steps. David then goes on to describe each stage in detail to help the reader better understand it, and help her to implement techniques and tools to make her more efficient within it. Besides discussing individual tasks, the author spends significant time discussing projects - which require multiple tasks to be completed in order to bring them to close. He goes on to describe how these can be managed using the same framework. This enables handling tasks, regardless of size, scope and/or complexity in a standard manner. One thing that sets this book apart is it's focus just as equally on the ""not to do"" than on the ""to do"" - which are fundamentally two sides of the same coin.Below are some excerpts that I personally found to be very enlightening:a) ""You need no new skills to increase your productivity - just a new set of behaviors about when and where to apply them.""b) ""the sense of anxiety and guilt doesn't come from having too much to do; it's the automatic result of breaking agreements with yourself.""c) ""Organizations must create a culture in which it is acceptable that everyone has more to do than he or she can do, and in which it is sage to renegotiate agreements about what everyone is not doing.""d) ""Real ""togetherness"" of a group is reflected by the responsibility that all take for defining the real things to do and the specific people assigned to do them, so everyone is freed of the angst of still-undecided actions.""e) ""Getting things going of your own accord, before you're forced to by external pressure and internal stress, builds a firm foundation of self-worth that will spread into every aspect of your life. You are the captain of your own ship; the more you act from that perspective, the better thing will go for you.""A very highly recommended read in the area of personal productivity.

"Without hesitation, I can tell you that this is the greatest time management book I have ever read. In addition it may be one of the best business books I have ever read. Here's why: I've become better organized, more efficient, more valuable, while increasing my performance at every step of the way.So, what's in the book? A simple system clearly explained in everyday language. David Allen writes as if he was talking to you. The book gets straight to the point and you can get straight to work. To be honest, when I first read the book I realized the great advice inside but did nothing. A couple months later I reread the book and started taking action. Almost immediately my inbox was reduced from an average of 80 to 90 e-mails to zero. Zero! Over a year later, my inbox is still at zero. My quality of work is improving as well. I'm taking more action, procrastinating less, and I am literally getting things done. I now have more quality time at work and at home thanks to this text and a little effort and persistence on my part.This is the first book I can ever remember truly sharing with friends and colleagues. I have already handed out more than six copies and plan to hand out more as time goes on.

"I'll start by saying that a lot of the overall ideas in GTD are useful. I don't have a problem with the system itself. What I have a problem with is the book. David Allen is a productivity consultant, not a writer; and this book shows that.The first chapter is completely useless. It amounts to a lot of chest beating and promoting a book that you've already bought and a system you're already going to try. To summarize the beginning of the book can be done in a single paragraph:""This system will instill in you a continual sense of relaxed control. No seriously, you will be relaxed, while in control. You know I teach this to people who pay me money, and afterwards they are in relaxed control and love it. It is, in essence, the best system ever. Once you know about it's amazing aspects, you will be amazed. In short, this system is great.""It uses a lot of words to say very little. I sort of wonder if he was just going on and on just to increase his word count. The actual implementation and details of what the system IS doesn't get covered until significantly later.Another issue with this book is that the ordering isn't very useful. For the first several chapters he mentions placing things into a ""Tickler"" file, but doesn't tell you what a tickler file actually is. It's not until Chapter 7 (page 173) that the tickler system is actually explained. And it's a neat system. I can see how it would be really handy. Unfortunately now I feel like I'll have to read those first 173 pages to remember where he was talking about using a tickler file. There was no context on what that file was to really ground the thought with the reader. It's problems like this that make me feel like this book could have done with a stronger editor that would have been willing to rearrange the book to logically build upon itself. That same editor should have also removed roughly half of the useless pages that merely sound like ego boosting of the author on how his system is great.In essence, the ideas of this book are good. The writing is terrible. If someone were to write a second book that was maybe 100 pages total and distilled the system to it's essence, that would be a good book.

"---Summary---Getting Things Done has become a best seller and is today the most important reference in the ""getting things done"" topic. This is not by chance!The book starts by saying that nowadays, we have more and more demands and insufficient resources to fulfill them. The goal is thus to capture anything you consider unfinished out of your mind in a trusted system. Then, the idea is to first define the problem, the success, and the next action toward success. Finally, you do and follow up.---Model/concepts---The goal is not to manage your ""stuff"", but to manage your actions needed to bring your ""stuff"" to success:  1.  Collect - In the system out of the head; Few collection buckets; Empty buckets regularly.  2.  Process - Actionable?No, then set it  as trash, maybe later, or potentially useful;Yes, then define action, do if < 2min, delegate, or defer & track.  3.  Organize - Actions on calendar, next action by context (calls, computer, office, etc.), and waiting for.  4.  Review - Weekly gather & process new ""stuff"", review calendar, update action lists.  5.  Do - Choose by context (where am I?), time available, energy available, priority.---Impact---Huge, really!There are two key points in Allen's approach that are highly powerful: - Get ""stuff"" out of your head in a trusted system. - Think and act in term of actions toward success not in term of problems.The book gives all the necessary material to do that, and it works. Once you have no stuff in your head, and you know that with your system you can correctly handle it, your life is much easier. Additionally, the concept of action thinking/acting is extremely powerfull to face problems in a positive and simple way.This has played an important role in my working life when my company has moved from the ""few friends"" start-up phase to the ""leader & team"" structure. Before, I was still involved in some development, and I had quite long slots to perform relatively few different tasks.

"The crucial thing about David Allen's method is that it aligns on several levels with how the brain works.  Allen devotes most of his book to reinforcing how his system goes with how the human brain works.  Unlike many of the other reviewers, I place more importance in understanding what the system is supposed to do than in the system specifications.  That's because once you understand how the system mimics the way a brain would optimally think, the organization of it can evolve naturally.Allen is often credited with making or at least advancing a more realistic method than just maintaining a list of A, B and C priority task items.  He identified our main problem as loading the mind with stressful noise, those seemingly infinite loops when we keep thinking of hundreds of things we intend to do.  This creates mental clutter, and that kills both creativity and productivity.  Mental clutter and clutter in general harms the quality of life.The Getting Things Done method (GTD) is very specific.  You can and will improvise, but the basics seem to be established simply by the nature of how our brains function.  We have an alpha system for our main projects, but there are so many other things going on.  Separately, we should maintain an area for things we intend to read.  Another subsystem is perhaps just one or maybe more hanging files are for those things that can only be classified as ""someday maybe.""  We'll need a tickler file - the subsystem I've never been able to keep up with for long.  These systems can all be represented in one graph.There is an art to using GTD.  It's ok if we don't all do it the same way.  One concern, for example, is to find the best way to store a subsystem.  You don't necessarily want it all in eyesight, but you want easy access and you don't want to be able to forget about it.

"Unlike typical books on time management, David Allen takes a unique approach to organizing one's life which is centered around keeping lists.  The problem is that he has no clue how to efficiently explain his ideas.This is a 267 page book on To Do Lists that wanders all over the place and does not cover any topic completely in one section.  It took me an excruciating 2 months to read.  To be fair, I have found David Allen's ideas to be sound, but the mechanism in which he delivers them is poor.The author presents a flow chart but instead of starting with one box and explaining it fully before moving on, he only scratches the surface and then immediately shifts to the next box and the next box.  Then he starts over and sprinkles more info about each box, and he does this again and again for the full 267 pages.  The book must be read in order, you cannot skip around.  Now that I have finished the book, it is not really possible to go back and review anything because if I have a question about one of the boxes in the flow chart, I can't go to one place in the book and learn all about it.A better way to disseminate this information would have been to provide a poster-sized flow chart (with summaries of each box in the margins around the perimeter) and an hour-long DVD.  If it has to be explained in book format, David Allen should have kept the book under 50 pages.  I still would have paid the same price.I am rating this book with 3 stars because the information is useful, it is just presented in a way that utterly frustrated me before it enlightened me.  A great alternative book on time management that I can bounce around and read a fragment here, a chapter there, in any order is ""How to Have a 48-Hour Day"" by Don Aslett.",267 Pages?

"The book's cover says ""The Art of Stress-Free Productivity"" and I have to say it delivered on that right away.  Here's what helped me most:Get it out of your headProbably the biggest thing that helped was the concept of ""getting it out of your head"".  My head was filled with things I needed to keep track of.  The problem was I would remind myself of what those things were constantly - mostly in the middle of the night.  GTD recommends you write out each thought, idea, etc. on a separate piece of paper.  I used to make lists, but then I would see a laundry list of things to do and become drained.  It makes sense to write down each thing on its own page because you can't process all the things you need to do at the same time.  We usually do things one item at a time.  This in of itself was a huge benefit.  If an idea pops into my head, I write it down.  Once I do (and of course make sure it goes into a system that will guarantee my next action) then it's released from my head, freeing me up.Two minute ruleThis is about going through your inbox and doing whatever is in there that can be done in two minutes or less.  Sounds simple because it is!  And it's amazing how quickly I can reduce my inbox.  The thinking behind this is that sometimes it takes longer to store and track something than just to do it!Grouping like activitiesMake all your calls one after the other - whether they're related or not.  Take a block of time and send your emails out.  If you have magazines stacked up - read the cover story of each - that's the most important.Is it actionable?Whatever you're trying to manage either has a next step or doesn't.  GTD teaches you how to categorize things so that you always know what to do with them.  This was especially true with projects.  The book points out that you really never do a project, you do the next actionable thing towards getting that project done.GTD has increased my productivity and reduced my stress.  I no longer miss appointments, or wake up in the middle of the night wondering if I finished something.  The book is very intuitive and I would highly recommend it.  FYI - it does take a while to incorporate the whole system.  If you make a commitment to doing so, you will benefit tremendously.And if you have a goal you've been putting off - read ""Goal your 30 day game plan for Business and Career Success""Goal!: Your 30-Day Game Plan for Business and Career Success It was recommended to me and I achieved a goal I had put off for years.

"This book was written in 2001 before there was any software made that took advantage of David Allen's ideas therefore it does not talk about all the great software that has brought his ideas to a whole new level. Doing GTD with out paper solutions doesn't allow for you to filter your tasks by certain criteria or set reminders for when things are due (David says that you should use a separate calender, in my own experience I have found it far better to do this with in the GTD program itself.) The book says that you should get everything out of your in box and into projects. He then goes on to make an exception saying that you can leave your email in box alone. Now that there are great GTD programs out there I think it makes sense to get those tasks out of your in box as well. Many of these programs have quick entry windows that make a breeze to sort things like emails.In the book he tells about how people complain when he tells them to keep buying more filing cabinets to store all the paper that these solutions require! Now days that we have not only computers but handheld as well as with the rising popularity of tablets like the iPad those old style solutions make no sense. I really have to wonder the reason to why David hasn't updated the book it's not like he is unaware of what is happening with the new technology. After all he is an OmniFocus user like I am (probably the best program out there by the way.)

"I've read quite a few time management books lately, all in hopes of finding my sweet spot, a system that would work for me to help me balance my time in a more efficient manner.I can safely say that this book, ""Getting Things Done"", describes precisely the system that works for me. I read through the book slowly, and took time to implement the processes described in the book as I went along. The only feeling that comes to mind when describing how the book effected me is relief. I felt an enormous amount of relief while implementing the system, and it has really helped me to clear my mind, and regain my focus.The system works as follows (in a very rough, quick description):1. Write down *everything* on your mind. Put it into a list somewhere.2. Go through your list, and determine the next 'action step' for each item. For example, if you want to ""clean your garage"", the next step may be ""sweep the floor"".3. Any list items that take less than 2 minutes to complete, do them, and cross them off.4. Now go through your list again, and begin working on actions, crossing them off as you go.The idea behind the 'Getting Things Done' system is to simplify all of your tasks, problems, and thoughts, by breaking them down into smaller, simpler steps.What I like most about this system, is that it is extremely logical. Being a programmer, I often use the same system for breaking down software into small simple problems, then tackling them one at a time. However, I never considered doing the same to my life (both personal and professional).The ""Getting Things Done"" system is fabulous.

"GTD, The Art Of Stress Free Productivity provides you with both a detailed and most importantly, an overall view of the GTD system.Frankly, the system is not much of a new invention as much as it is a reinvention. The book serves as a great way (for those who already employ a similar system, even an intuitive one like mine) to assess your current status and detect any failures in your own system and help fix & enhance these failures positively thus increasing your efficiency, productivity & ultimately  your energy. I say this because the GTD system itself is not something new (at least not for me), but rather a collection of ""common sense"" -as David Allen puts it-, logical and semi-straightforward (ranges from one process to another) techniques that are easy & logical enough for anyone to think off and employ them.The system might be new to many, especially those who never have experienced or felt the sense of being overloaded or exhausted of the astronomical input of everyday life & the lack of a good organizing & processing system to handle them; but is obvious enough and very needed for those who did experience that.The book may be considered as a good reboot (in a ""transition"" sense rather than the regular reboot meaning) of your current system into a new efficient one or a refreshing tool to those who already have a similar system. I personally have found it to be a refreshing tool as I have discovered that my own ""intuitive-based"" system is very similar to GTD's. While reading the book, I crossed off around 90% of the basic tools needed to implement the system because I have already been employing.For example, I have already been using paper holding trays (3 as David recommends as the least), filters & labels to automatically organize my email inbox & processing incoming emails as described in the book (automatic filtering & labeling is not mentioned though), using To Do lists (which after reading has been changed to multiple bulleted lists and ""action lists"" which I found to be much more comfortable). Some of these tools I already had, have been used inefficiently, like, as an example, the stacks of reading & reviewing material lying on my desk or near my bed.Just very recently, I have bought ""file folders"" for my desk drawer which are to be employed very soon, something I didn't have previously or even thought it could be helpful, but the explanations in the book raised my attention to its potentials especially when it comes to projects files, referencing & archiving material.Finally, I have high expectations regarding this development of my system (which I can now call it by the GTD system), but I will give it a 12 months period to make sure that my expectations are in the right place & during which this period I will further develop & master the GTD's system techniques.Good Luck in yours.",Not a New invention but a system that's common sense & worth it,"September 16, 2010",4.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEPF23P4FWEADKPLDXZUZ64YRB7A,Bob

"Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity is touted as the common sense approach to organizing your life. It is based on the idea that putting all your commitments on paper instead of keeping them in your head will make you more productive. By keeping an evolving file of tasks and ""to-dos"" at hand, you are able to focus on the most important or current ones without forgetting the rest.Fans of Getting Things Done, or ""GTD,"" stand by the system as a complete method for keeping yourself organized and productive. The ""Two-Minute Rule"" is worth noting: If you have a task that you can finish in two minutes or less right now, then do it. It frees you up to move on to another quick task or tackle a longer one. The system does require some willpower to get going. Procrastinators will want to put off the quick tasks out of hand. But if you really want to put some structure in your life, it is worth taking a look at this book. The accompanying website ([...]) has forums, podcasts, articles, and a blog to help you stay on track and get advice from other GTD users.Fast Company Magazine has called author David Allen the ""personal productivity guru,"" a reputation his clients will back up.

"Core Idea: You can gain control of your life by following a five-stage process: 1) Collect 2) Process 3) Organize 4) Review and 5) Do.We have too many things on our minds. Unfinished tasks and unfulfilled commitments create stress and pressure. There is no way to achieve relaxed control if we keep everything only in our minds. ""Managing actions"" means deciding what to do at any point in time. Almost always the problem is not lack of time but the clarity about what to do next.1) Collect all the things in a trusted system so that your mind can let go.2) Process your list by asking ""What is it?"" and ""Is it actionable?"" If it is actionable decide what the next action is.3) Organize the outcomes of your process in a trusted system.4) Weekly Review your organized system to see what is getting done.5) Doing entails doing pre-defined work, doing work that shows up or defining your work.In the final analysis, deciding and doing really comes down to a matter of trusting our hearts, our minds, our spirits or our guts. This trust cannot be fully defined yet alone captured in any known system to mankind yet. However, David Allen's GTD system gives a better idea and a better foundation for doing so.

"I had a clutter problem - in general.  So I got a book on clutter (""It's All Too Much"" which is a good read btw).  It worked!  ...on everything except my relationship with papers.  They are (soon to be 'were') everywhere: messing up my home office, the table where I eat, on the night stand, even on the floor.  I mean, it looked like clutter so why didn't it work?  Well, because my paper issue was some else entirely - an organization puzzle, not an extra-stuff puzzle.This is where David Allen's book really comes in handy.  It's especially good for everyday people whose lives are getting more multifaceted and whose personal and/or professional projects are getting bigger.  The logic is impeccable.

"The Good:David Allen presents quite a bit of helpful information in this book.  GTD is a very valuable read if you find your email gets out of sorts or your desk becomes cluttered with papers more frequently than you would like.  One quite useful idea Allen presents is that of ""Stuff"".  ""Stuff"" for Allen is ""Anything you have allowed into your psychological or physical world that doesn't belong where it is, but for which you haven't yet determined the desired outcome and the next action step.""  Allen suggests the presence of ""Stuff"" makes work difficult; it engenders internal resistance to work.  Cutting down on ""stuff"" is the basis of Allen's system and becoming more productive.Allen suggests creating inboxes to place your ""Stuff"" in order to get them out of your mental RAM.  One common example (albeit maybe old-fashioned) is the physical inbox on a desk.  Allen suggests creating such an inbox and placing all cluttered papers and ""Stuff"" on your desk in it.  This frees up your mental RAM a bit as the ""Stuff"" is out of sight and out of mind.  When the inbox is first created it will be quite full, but once that initial hill of  ""Stuff"" is processed, the inbox should stay fairly empty as its owner should be frequently processing it.  Allen provides a workflow diagram for processing ""Stuff"" and suggests doing so at least weekly.Using this workflow, it is easy to cut through an inbox.  This really helps one get a handle on their work and getting things done!  I can attest to this as I've organized my email according to this methodology, and it works quite well.  In Outlook I now have four main folders: inbox, next actions, waiting, and reference.  Reference contains most of my previous folders; its where I store materials I might need to reference at some point.  Waiting contains items I'm waiting on deliverables/dependencies from others before I can proceed.  Next actions contains the next things I need to do that will take more than 2 minutes (if less than 2 minutes, I do them on the spot as per the diagram above).  And my inbox is nearly at zero (always).  That has probably been the biggest gift the book offered me.  I review emails daily and file them according to the workflow system and am able to maintain a near zero inbox.  This really catalyzes my productivity.So, the good from GTD:  ""Stuff"" principle, a physical inbox, the workflow, and (at least) weekly reviews of inboxes.Another less but still beneficial principle Allen suggests is practicing ""ubiquitous capture"".  Ubiquitous means ever-present or constant; the principle Allen suggests is to make a habit of constantly capturing your ideas.  Never be without a pen and paper (or a PDA for some).  This way you are able to capture ideas regardless of when they occur, and more importantly, your mental capacity is freed up from having to try to remember ideas.  Jot your idea down on a 3x5 card and drop it in your inbox and forget about it.  Focus on what is at hand and process it in your weekly review.The Bad:Yes, there is bad in GTD.  First, the view of technology is antiquated.  For example, Allen states that before implementing his system a person will need to purchase:  paper-holding trays (at least 3), a stack of plain letter-size paper, post-its (3x3s), paper clips, binder clips, a stapler, scotch tape, rubber bands, an automatic labeler, and file folders.  Any system that requires all of the preceding is simply not making effective use of technology.  Furthermore GTD is overly reliant on paper and physical filing.  It would be quite difficult to fully implement GTD electronically, and this is a major drawback given the growing movement to more and more electronic organization of work.  Also, Allen's system is not flexible enough to handle diverse environments.  If you Google GTD, you find many adaptations to his system people have needed to make in order to fit it to their specific situations.What to Keep:So what will GTD mean to me?  Well, I now keep a physical inbox on my desk, I've reorganized my email (and have a tiny inbox!), complete a bi-weekly review, and utilize a simplified version of the workflow (the diagram above).  I find that this frees up my mental capacity to work more effectively and be more productive.  GTD is not a complete solution, and is certainly not perfect, but the basic ideas have proven helpful.* Last, I should qualify my review here.  I am leaving out vast segments of the GTD system for brevity's sake.  Also, I did not read the latest edition of the book (I read the 2001 version), and the newer edition might make more effective use of technology.","GTD: The Good, the Bad, and What to Keep","July 2, 2010",4.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGJQTDP7K7IEPKA7C5O2DKGYJDMQ,Frank Jacobsen
"I have long been frustrated because I am one of the millions out there who has too much to do and I never seem to get anything done. Enter this book. The most important thing I got from this book is the concept of collecting, processing, organizing, deciding what steps to take, and acting on it. Such a straightforward and simple process completely organizes your tasks so you can tackle each one with ease. Another important thing I learned is that keeping your mind clear (by organizing and listing down every task that needed to be done) clears up your mind so you can focus on the task at hand.

"As the first book of my _Five_Book_Challenge_ (see more at [...]) I have been fighting with the yin and yang -- productive and un/counter-productive -- sides of myself since I was in my teens.  It has been a never ending struggle for me to organize my thoughts, actions, responsibilities, and so on in order to streamline the way in which I deal with things.  Enter _Getting_Things_Done_.  I was skeptical at first; I have read tens of books on this topic, and some have been helpful, but none has been a magic bullet.  Mr. Allen's information is somewhat dated, dealing with the limited technology available in the early 2000s, when this book was written.  Nevertheless, his overarching strategy can be timeless.  He goes through ever step of the system multiple times to make sure the reader understands.  His language is direct but not abrasive, and he has a way of cutting through self-created nonsense to help us...well...get things done.  Allen is quick to stay away from any philosophical implications as well as any goal setting.  This is my only gripe.  I would have like to have at least seen some sort of an epilogue with how to handle these things best.  He glances on the ""altitudes"" of goal setting, but I just felt like there could have been some expansion here.  His system involves a lot of things I already unconsciously do or things I have thought were good ideas but never acted on them; rather than being redundant, though, this helped to solidify the system further for me.  At times, audio books can lose something in the translation, so to speak, but not the case here.  It would be nice to be able to jot _some_ things down, but I listened to the entire thing in my car, and I am satisfied.

"I have ADD. It's fashionable to have ADD. In my CEO development group, everyone jokes that they have it. But I really do. Diagnosed and medicated. I don't have it bad, but I have it.Like lots of people with ADD, I can focus. The danger is when I turn from one thing to the next. When I do, things get dropped, misplaced, forgotten. There is too much to do; we all have that problem. But there is always so much going on in my head, that what another person might luckily recall doesn't occur to me.  Out of sight is truly out of mind.So, I've always struggled with getting the important things done. That's why David's book is such a gift. It describes principles for keeping things organized.

There are companies and web sites devoted to exploring and elaborating on Allan's principles, so I won't try to enumerate them all here. Let me instead highlight what is so valuable about Allen's approach.Much of the value is that he is not advocating a specific system. The principles can be applied to whatever method works for you. It can be paper or electronic, PC or Mac. As long as you get ideas out of your head, keep tasks separated by stage (like don't file things in your inbox), review all your commitments each week, and apply the other principles to whatever system works for you, you'll get the results.While my discipline is not perfect, Allan's guidelines have helped me immeasurably.

"Unlike a generation of self-help gurus that preceded him, David Allen does not promise the stars in the heavens above for those that follow his method or his teaching, but simply offers a tool kit to increase productivity. The GTD method requires a big frontloaded commitment to set the 'full' system up -Allen often spends days with clients getting it up and running- and introduces a number of almost-gimmicky components (the 'tickler' file; the use of the labeller) which are innovative, and in a way, beguiling.One of the problems with the system is that the 'wow, that's neat' factor can lead to an almost fetishistic devotion to the intricacies that leads people to focus on being 'meta-productive' instead of actually being productive (if you are prone to procrastination in the first place then you should be very wary of the 'bright and shiny' aspects of GTD that so many people get hung up on). Certainly, Allen himself offers no psychological solution for the problem of procrastination; during a podcast with Melvin Mann over at 43 Folders, the best Allen can come up with is, once you are 'clear' and have all your various folders and lists set up with 'next actions', if you aren't going to do what you really should be doing, you'll still have a a variety of productive things to get on with whilst you avoid your primary task. Which is, of course, no solution at all.Nonetheless, it seems a bit unfair to Allen to criticise him for not offering advice on something -the psychology of motivation and procrastination- that he never said he was an expert in. (Some books that dovetail nicely with GTD, that do offer a detailed social psychological analysis of this, are Switch: How to Change Things When Change Is Hard,Talent Is Overrated, and Brain Rules). One of the refreshing things about Allen is that he isn't trying to sell you a snake-oil solution to every problem you've ever had, and he even says that if you implement a little bit of GTD, you should see big changes (something I can personally attest to- while my tickler file is largely unloved, his 'next action' mantra has changed the way I make lists, and I utilise a stripped down 'capture/collect/process' system that was very easy to implement and incredibly useful).Ultimately, there is no smoke without a fire; Allen has his detractors, and many self-help gurus have been happy to repackage his work with their own bells and whistles (The Truth about Getting Things Done); the lifehacker types (Upgrade Your Life) have swarmed over GTD and embellished it with moleskin notebooks and freeware computer programs; Cal Newport, author of the brilliant book How to Become a Straight-A Student runs a website called Study Hacks that provides a stripped down GTD version for students; Melvin Mann over at 43 Folders grapples with how 'right-brained' creative types can implement GTD out of the business world and in their own, less conventional life. All these people have been enriched or influenced by Allen's work -as have I. Despite it's flaws then, the innovations of Getting Things Done mark it out as a unique, insightful system that offers real nuts-and-bolts solutions for organization in the twenty first century.","Unfairly maligned by it's detractors, but not inerrant","April 17, 2010",4.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHZ3M5M34FFRIEMHZWIYXF3BQI2Q,Cheese Steak Jimmy

"English is not my native language but I do write and publish in English myself. I was very disappointed with the style and narrative. It is slow and still jumpy with little to follow. The book is way too long for its core message that can be nailed down in maybe ten highlights.Additionally, I do have a problem with the approach to getting my life organized. I am terrible with doing things on time and wish sometimes I could do it better. But eventually I realized that this simply isn't me. Getting overly organized ruins my creativity and spontaneity! I found however out that there are a lot of things that simply are not that important Put a stop to other people dictating your life! Do not check your emails if you don't want to, turn off the phone (the'll leave a message anyway), train people to leave you emails or SMS instead. Many things solve themselves or are solved by others. So don't be a busybody. Learn to prioritize by things that you enjoy doing. You will end up doing more enjoyable things and you will be better at them than by doing important (to others) things and you end up being constantly badgered by those.I think it is silly to tell people that a certain time of day is the best to do your work. Everyone is different. Find out which is the best time for you. I like to work nights because I am more creative. Disconnecting yourself by disconnecting the communication lifeline is the best organizing feature these days. The other one: TURN OFF THE TV AND THE RADIO! There is nothing of value coming your way. Just distraction. Get an iPod or similar if you like music. Have conversations about subjects (even online) rather than just being passively swamped with stuff you don't need. Even the weather report is ruining your life. Enjoy the surprise of rain or sunshine.Take control of your life by not letting tasklists dominate your time.

"Why You Should Read It: Time is the only real scarce resource. We are all battling for more of it. The only way to have more is to spend it wisely.Review:I just finished Getting Things Done. I know. I'm a little late to the game. It was a quick read and I loved the premise. There were no doubt some clear productivity ""ah-ha's"" as I read. I have spent a lot of time learning and developing my own productivity system over the years and I'm excited to implement a few more of Allan's nuggets. Most of the things he mentions are not totally novel but the package he puts them in catches an eye.Top 6 Ways to Quadruple Productivity and Have a Little More Time to Enjoy Life:1. ""What is the next task that will get me toward my desired outcome?"" This is the biggest point Allen drives home. Always ask this question upon completion of a meeting or task. This alone will put your productivity through the roof. Let this be the last time that you leave the site of a goal, plan or meeting without a clearly defined and scheduled next action item to make it a reality.2. Plan Your Week. Spend at least a half hour or an hour at the beginning (or end) of each week taking stock of what you accomplished the prior week, what you didn't accomplish, what you learned and what your desired outcomes are for the week to come. Many people dive right into the week with no plan of what they want their week to look like. And then get frustrated when nothing gets done. Be intentional and get committed. Things will start to happen. Spend an hour sharpening the saw to makes the week's cutting all the easier. I have been doing this every week for years.3. Schedule It. Things do not get done unless you schedule them. By definition in order for a task to be completed it must physically occupy some portion of your life. Lists have become so arbitrary. They get longer and longer and are rarely prioritized, leaving you overwhelmed when everything doesn't get checked off. Also, the average person drastically under estimates how long something will take (at least we're optimistic). This causes them to put 27 hours worth of work on one day's list. Reserving time on your calendar forces you to be honest with yourself and get completed only what is reasonable in the time you have available. Proper expectations are a huge part of getting things done.4. Schedule A Buffer. We have now come to grips with the fact that everything takes longer than expected. Now except the fact that things always come up that we didn't plan. They take time and sometimes they have to happen right away. Schedule buffer time for these. I literally block off an hour or two each day that simply says ""buffer time"". It almost always gets filled up with something urgent and unexpected and when it doesn't, I have an hour of my life back-an amazing feeling. That's when it's time to get outside and have some fun (or do whatever you like to do with spare time-other than check email).5. Give Yourself Strict and Short Deadlines. This is not contradictory to Schedule It. Yes, things take longer than expected, and they also will take up as much time as you have available. We call this Parkinson's Law. The time required to complete a project is directly proportional to the time you have available. In other words, if you have time to waste, you will waste it. You have a day to study for an exam. It takes a day. You have two weeks to study. It takes two weeks. Give yourself enough time to complete a task but not a moment more. Set these limits up in advance.6. Don't Check Email First Thing in the Morning. If you haven't heard this before, you have not been listening. This is huge. No matter what you're doing, email will immediately throw you off and suck the time and energy out of your life. Get your most important things done in the first 2-3 hours of the day. Then check some email and a little Facebook. I know I do not need to convince you on merit of this. I just need to break you from your addiction.7. Do Your Most Import Things First. This goes with the above. First thing in the morning (after a good workout and breakfast), since I already have a plan for the week, I know what's most important for the day. So I dive into those 2-3 tasks first. Often before even opening my computer or connecting to the internet, and definitely before checking email. You will feel mountains better about the rest of the day with your major items behind you. Then there's plenty of time to waste away on email.8. Get a Good System to Keep Track of Your Life. Everyone does things differently and no system will be perfect for all of us. But there are some amazing tools out there for free or almost free to get you started. Whatever the cost, if it gets you organized and motivates you to get things done, it's worth the investment. I use a combination of the Tony Robbins Time of Your Life Planning System, 7 Habits and 4-Hour Work Week in conjunction with my iCal, Google Calendar, Things and Evernote, all synced to my iPhone for what I feel has become my own little work of art. Can't forget a good clean work space of your own and maybe some physical file cabinets either. It took a while for me to get the right system in place and its always changing, but it's empowering once you get it. Find some sexy productivity toys and have some fun.These steps are easy and any one of them alone will dramatically transform the way you go about your moments, days, weeks and life.

"Summary: This book focuses on how to get organized from the ground level up. While it mentions working out your life goals and the bigger parts of being happy, the book excels in how to prioritize and clean put your in-box.Details: Allen clearly describes his system for getting control of all the over-communication we have to deal with in the modern office. He recommends organizing your calendar, task and most importantly your email box in specific ways. I tried his recommendation and I feel that I am just as organized, but more importantly it takes me a lot less effort. He strongly believes that if you can do a small task in under 2 minutes, do it now (unless the next meeting you have starts in 2 minutes). The time spent remembering and the energy wasted to make sure you don't forget this mini-task adds up to more time than the tasks takes. So do it now! I think that is the best idea of the book.He hardest thing for me has been balancing his ideas at work, where they have been very successful for me, and at home where there are still lots of things to get done. The writing is a bit preachy, but its OK.The Takeaway: Easy to read, engaging, if a bit pedantic. But I enjoyed it and it has made me more productive and less stressed.",Good concrete tips,"February 6, 2010",4.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFNKDQEIQK6JY4BHY7PZJC76TKJA,Timothy S. Wade

"Does your life feel disorganized? Is your inbox overflowing and desk growing more and more cluttered? Do you tend to put things off until the very last minute? Do you feel like your schedule is dictated by the tyranny of the urgent? Then take the time to read this book. It could literally change your life.Early on, the author gives a five-step process to getting control of your life. First, he says to collect every single item or `open loop' in life that commands your attention and is sapping your energy. Second, begin to systematically process what each item means and what to do about it. Third, go deeper by organizing the results. Fourth, regularly review the progress you are making and re-negotiate your priorities. Fifth, go and do it!The rest of the book unpacks these five principles with many helpful step-by-step instructions and examples. One thing can be said about David Allen: he takes nothing for granted. He doesn't just tell you; he shows you. He knows that by the time you pick up his book you may already be overwhelmed and on the brink of burnout. He is patient and walks you through the entire process. It's like having a personal productivity coach.Probably the most helpful summary of the GTD system is found on page 36, where Allen captures the whole process in graphic form. At first, the workflow chart may resemble an engineering schematic, but it's actually a template of simple ideas that can be adapted to any profession, from stay at home mom to Fortune 500 CEO.Though already a fairly organized person, I found GTD invaluable.

Just using some of Allen's tips and tricks can prove very useful. I've recommended this book to many clients, most of which are time-deprived owners of emerging enterprises.The only challenge I see with implementing GTD in full, is having 1-2 days to properly setup the system in the first place.

"GTD is clearly the new standard for personal organization in the 21st century. David Allen has defined a personal information management system that is flexible enough for anyone to implement, detailed enough to handle the busiest of people, and simple enough for everyone to benefit--no matter how seriously they decide to follow it. I have often been called ""Mr. Organization"" and at least three different sources recommended this book to me before I got it and read it. I started out thinking that I was already organized enough, not realizing what I was missing. Now, I have a much better understanding of the value of a ""ubiquitous idea capturing tool"" and a central set of lists. My personal implementation has been several pocket-sized notebooks and a set of Excel spreadsheets, but you may prefer any of the dozens of other high-tech or low-tech options.

"Getting Things Done is more than just another productivity book. GTD (as it's sometimes abbreviated) is a methodology that helps you organize your countless projects, tasks, errands, lists, and even your ideas so you can be free to think about what's really important... what you're working on right now.I first read GTD several years ago, and have since been using the system both at work and in my everyday projects and tasks. Some people think using a system like this is too rigid, and limits you from being able to be spontaneous or make decisions. It's not true at all... if anything GTD actually frees you up to be more flexible because it eliminates all those little things that fall through the cracks and then become big emergencies.I believe in GTD so much, I regularly buy copies to give to clients and colleagues (which is what I just did recently).

"I've read the book more than once. I've seen David Allen on video delivering a presentation, which is quite good and available at many locations on the web. And now I have him reading the book on CD.  The Getting Things Done system is deceptively complex. Even David Allen admits to ""falling off the wagon"".  Allen has a good speaking voice and reads with both animation and conviction. I am not sure that the audio CD, however, would be usable without the book. There is a lot of subtle detail in the book that needs to be read several times to pick it all up.  But if you own the book, the audio CD is definitely a fine adjunct. Listen to it on your commute. Or during a break. Use it to reinforce your GTD habits. You might consider listening to it as you wake or fall asleep.  Getting Things Done is s system that has to made a part of the fabric of your entire life and being. It isn't easy - and any tool that helps you do it is worthwhile.

"I read this book on the recommendation of a friend, a librarian. I figure librarians ought to know a thing or two about organization. What surprised me was that after she gave me the logical reasons for acquiring the book, she gave emotional reasons, ""David Allen changed my life. And Roger's (her husband)."" This is a woman not given to hyperbole.The book hasn't yet changed my life because I haven't yet enacted all the recommendations but it has made my life less crazy. Allen recommends reading the book, then scheduling two days when you do nothing but organize your work. I had pressing deadlines which didn't allow me to do that, but I had had some close ""ball dropping"" calls so I did as much as I could in about 4 hours:1) Buy a list app for my iPhone (Listomni, about $8)2) Go through the notes I had on all my projects (5 projects)3) Create the kind of lists Allen said I needed4) Start to work the listsAllen revealed the reason I was suddenly struggling with my To Do's: a lack of horizontal integration--integration across projects. I was accustomed to working 1 or 2 projects at a time. I had great vertical integration--integration of stuff to get done within a project--but no horizontal integration. Now I have horizontal integration as well.And the big thing you must do if you want this approach to succeed: the weekly review. It's mandatory.I highly recommend this book to anyone who has more stuff to do than they have time to do it in and is struggling with however they are organizing their work currently.

"I read the hype and now I know why so many people think so highly of this book - it truly changes the way you handle your work.  It may sound corny, but the text is full of many ""Aha!"" moments - such as Allen's explanation that until you ""collect"" a task or idea or action by writing it down, it lingers in your mind, to haunt you, distract you and drain your energy.  Allen's explanation of how our natural planning process - one that works every time we use it - is usually not accessed at work or when we have a major project at home.  Instead, we tend to do things in reverse order, or in some other convoluted sequence.  Allen explains the steps in natural planning and how they can very easily and to great success be applied at work and at home.  Another major insight is that to get things done, you need to start from the bottom up, or at runway level, to use Allen's analogy, and then move up to 10,000 feet, then 20,000 feet, etc., rather than beginning from the top-down, by trying to identify your values and purposem, and then identifying the descending issues - the day-to-day, runway stuff will obstruct your path anyway, unless you handle it first.  Yet another great piece of advice is the ""What's the next action?"" exercise, which forces you to think of the next, actual, physical action that needs to be taken to accomplish your task or move a project forward - vague and ambiguous statements and generalities just won't do.On the down side, this book is about some very admittedly mundane tasks, like filing and making lists.  For this reason, I think the book could have been enhanced by clearer examples and illustration.  There is an excellent example on the author's web site, for example, on how to use natural planning for a child applying to college.  Future editions should include such case studies.The biggest lift to get the system going is the initial step of collecting and organizing all your open loops.  It seems as if most of Allen's client take a whole day or even a weekend to do it.

"David Allen is the master of time management and his book ""Getting Things Done"" strikes out all other ideas and books that I have read. After reading just the first chapter, I had a significantly enhanced way of living. To be honest, almost all of us already KNOW the things brought forth in this book, however, David does a wonderful job of explaining why we as humans think and work the way we do and how changing minor things can greatly increase our productivity and enhance our state of mind.If you are new to the GTD philosophy (as was I), David walks through very plainly how to achieve a more relaxed and open state of mind, which in turn increases creativity and decreases stress. When all of the things you have to do are ""off of your mind"", your mind has the ability to do the work you want it to do instead of the work of remembering all of your tasks. This is the basis behind GTD and after the first two chapters, the remainder of the book is geared towards showing you how, step-by-step, to implement this process.I highly recommend this book to anyone who feels that their productivity is less than ideal; to anyone who has trouble sleeping at night because they have too many things running through their head; and to anyone who feels like they simply cannot finish a project that they start.

"As a college student with ADHD, this book helped me to finally get organized. I had read other books on organization and none was as helpful or succeeded in motivating me so much as this one.It is true that he tends to repeat the idea that clearing stuff out of your mind and getting it into a foolproof organizational system helps your brain function better, but that was the revolutionary idea that changed my attitude about getting organized. Before, I wouldn't bother because I felt I didn't have the time or energy to put into it ... but once I was convinced that an organizational system where nothing was left to float around in my brain would actually help me have MORE time and energy, I went about setting one up right away. Allen's frequently restating that principle was really beneficial to me.My room is clean and stays clean. I manage my time a lot better. I get homework done on time or close to it. I don't forget important things that come up. I don't let non-school-related tasks fall through the cracks. I have more time for social interaction. I am much happier and less stressed!You get the feeling that the book is directed at high-profile executives, but the principles and suggestions it contains can work for ANYONE who feels over-worked and over-stressed.

"I have to confess I started GTD with the same scepticism I read any self-help manual. As you may imagine, I'm not a big fan of this genre. Throughout the book, the author describes with agile and enthusiastic prose every aspect of this method (by the way named GTD). In a nutshell, the main goal of GTD is basically to be relaxed and focus on what you're doing at a moment. The way to get there involves following up a precise methodology based on writing everything down. Most of the book explains the structure and maintenance of the equipment (baskets, lists, cabinets and so forth) needed to keep the system working efficiently. If you're a good guy and fulfill the rules, all your stuff will be under control so your mind will be empy and you'll ultimately feel better.I think the GTD implementation requires a lot of self-control so I seriously doub that It goes well with most of the population. Although I've got a remarkable tendency to chaos and disorder, I've been working with a partial implementation of GTD for four months with good results. Gradually (against the book advice) I am implementing the whole methodology. My reason to try GTD is that it's simple and based on common sense. Till now I've noticed I'm more conscious of how much stuff I have to deal with on my daily basis. In short, for me GTD has actually meant more control.Back to the book, I must criticise the excessive enthusiasm that covers this type of books although I've been through worse times. The second negative aspect I have to mention is the length of the book. In my opinion is a bit lengthy and redundant mainly because it tries to emphasize over and over the key concepts. I actually prefer those books that get straight to the point...no offense, but life is short.:)To sum up, I recomend GTD to all of those who have lost control over their lifes and don't know how to manage so many projects and commitments.

"I've been a follower and advocate of David Allen and his philosophies and strategies for nearly 20 years.  When he came out with Getting Things Done, he tied all of his strategies together in a way that allows anyone struggling with productivity, efficiency, organization, time management, and life balance in a way few others have dared/succeeded.What differentiates David and GTD from others is that his work is truly substantial -- it isn't the ""rah rah"" that you so often get when looking through publications on time and life management -- it actually gets down into the nuts & bolts of systems and techniques that truly work!A serious student of time & life management would do very well starting here, diving deeply into this work/information, and then using this as the base for further exploration.  David's work actually spawned my career as a time & technology management speaker, trainer, and instructor, and opened up my new passion in effective e-mail management (following David's principles) that led me to writing my own book (and getting a publishing deal) on Taming the E-mail Beast.  His work is also the base for many other experts in the field, and this is not a mistake.

"I saw this book featured in BusinessWeek magazine recently, so I decided to give it a look...Wow!

I began to feel bogged down and constantly saying, ""There's too much!"" while the papers continued to mount on my desk and emails flooded my inbox. I needed a way to get all of my thoughts straight. While I still have a long way to go, Getting Things Done has definitely made a huge impact in pusing me in the right direction. I regularly have a clean desk surface and a clear idea of what is on my plate. I find myself feeling more productive and able to access necessary information much more quickly. Such a simple concept as maintaining a general-purpose ""A to Z"" filing system as opposed to trying to remember ""where I put what"" has turned things around for me in a big way. Being able to find what I need when I need it, and having well organized lists that I can access have been priceless for me.This doesn't mean that I can get everything done, but knowing what the full inventory is, and putting it on paper helps to alleviate the stress of the tasks gnawing at me and helps to put it all in perspective.

"Based on a recommendation from Patty, Huntley, the trainer at a project management class I recently attended, I picked up David Allen's book Getting Things Done.  It's my turn now to recommend it as a very useful reading.Getting Things Done provides a very practical, down-to-earth, useful plan for getting organized and sticking to it.  The book is divided into three parts: an overview of the system, a nuts-and-bolts detailed methodology, and a higher level examination of key principles.I suspect that a lot of the book was compiled from transcripts of the years of training seminars author David Allen has been giving on the matter of getting organized.  At least, this would explain one of the book's minor flaws, the uneven writing style and authorial voice.  Part 1 -- The Art of Getting Things Done, in particular, uses more of the trendy buzzwords I have come to expect from the Business section of an average bookstore.  It's not too terrible, he doesn't go crazy with jargon, but it's more noticeable than in the next section.Part 2 -- Practicing Stress-Free Productivity, is a very accessible, easily read series of practical steps to take in order to get organized and set up a home and office system.  I very much liked that for every step, several different tools and approaches were offered, from paper files to computer-based files to palm-top devices.  Allen makes it clear that there are many different ways to accomplish the task, and that you should pick tools that suit your needs, habits, knowledge, and lifestyle.Another aspect I like is that Allen integrates the methods for getting both your business and personal life organized, but without melding them into a single entity.  It's necessary for most of us to keep work and home separate, yet access the information in more than one place.  This is well addressed in the book.Part 3 -- The Power of the Key Principles steps back to look at the thinking that underpins the proposed method.  Allen shows good insight in deciding to expose the reader to the practical benefits of the method -- letting you take the car for a spin -- before trying to ""sell"" grand principles.  He understands that if you're reading this thinking about the mess in your office and the multitude of projects waiting for you, you won't be interested in focusing on principles.I'm fairly certain that this book can be useful for just about anyone.  Maybe it won't revolutionized your habits, and maybe you'll only get a few useful tips out of it -- or maybe you'll completely change your planning methods.  Either way, you should get something useful from this inexpensive little paperback.","No-nonsense, eminently practical advice","March 9, 2009",4.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGX3WGT6UEHRAZQKTQZZKV2RUMBQ,Sophie Lagace

"I've read a lot of books on time management in my life. Many of them provided ""useful tactics"" that helped free up a little time here and there, but did not dramatically alter my life. Getting Things Done is a book that offers a complete system for better time management. It covers most of the issues that a time constrained adult will likely face in their lives, and provides solutions to solve their time problems.While not every single topic in the book was useful, a large number of them were; this is a success rate I wish more books that I read enjoyed.Geoffrey SchmidtAuthor, The Busy Adult's Guide to Making College Happen!",Very thorough time management system,"January 9, 2009",5.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHEV7F6ARESRGMLYGGMR5GSGWETQ,Geoffrey Schmidt
"David Allen's Getting Things Done system is actually quite useful, but you certainly don't need to read this book to implement it. In fact, reading the book might turn you away from the methodology as it did me.There are definite, glaring problems with Allen's style. For example, he relies heavily on hypothetical cases, often providing examples that are very similar. This makes for a dull, repetitive read, and the simplicity of the examples makes the repetition seem a little offensive.Also, the illustrations in the book are practically useless. There's only one useful figure (a flowchart) in the whole book. In fact, Allen recognizes the significance of this flowchart by presenting it in three different places (see pp. 36, 120, 139 of the paperback)!In short, save the $15. If you're serious about developing a methodology, go to your friendly local bookstore, grab this book off the shelf, look at page 36 (or 120, or 139), memorize the flowchart, replace the book, and leave.

"Finally, the one true organizational system that focuses on outcome (productivity) instead of process. It actually clears your mind.Throughout the years, I have received formal and recurring employer sponsored training in both Daytimer and Franklin Covey organizational and time management system.  These were primarily paper based approaches. While clearly capable and expansive (if not expensive) systems (when properly trained), they engage you in processes that can be overwhelming.  Simply assembling the planner systems can be a chore that seems to never end (folders, sections, paper based contacts, project management tabs, task tabs, delegated tabs, A-Z filing system, calendar, goals tabs, priorities tabs, personal vs. business tabs, the list goes on). I often found myself more engaged in assembling and reassembling the system more than anything else.  By my conservative calculations, I must have spent at least $3,000 on various paper based systems over the last 5 years; not including software integration attempts (all failed).The GTD system breaks through the aforementioned paradigms and views everything in your life as ""stuff"" without regard to whether it is personal or business.  Essentially you have one intake point for everything.  From there, you decide where to place your ""stuff"" until it is actionable.  I will not bother getting into all the details in this review as there are many websites dedicated to the GTD philosphy that can do a much better job.Suffice it to say that the GTD system is analagous to an ever changing task list.  I use toodledo.com to manage my task list using the folder system in David's book.  Toodledo.com integrates with my Iphone so that I always have my task list with me everywhere I go.  It is important to note that appointments and meetings are treated as tasks and placed in the Agenda folder.The book is an easy read and there is an incredible amount of supplementary material on the web.

"This book is about organization. It says very little about prioritization and time-management. It contains nothing about actually *planning* or *doing* anything. The system boils down to making elaborate ""what I need to do next"" lists for every project you want to accomplish in your life, and to review and update these lists often. For every item on your list, either trash it, delegate it, save it for later, or just do it. It's good advice if you find yourself stuck at a roadblock or overwhelmed by a sheer number of tasks.According to the book, pretty much every project consists of an endless string of simple tasks such as ""call X"", ""email Y"", and ""attend meeting with Z"". Unfortunately the book barely discusses the planning required for difficult jobs that involve significantly more time and forward thinking than accomplishing the most immediate step. It's all about ""go go go"" and ""do do do"". If you have five minutes to spare, it's time to check your list for a call you could make or an email you could write. The resulting productivity strikes me as borderline manic. If you need to keep a folder of Post-It notes in a filing cabinet to deal with your spouse (as the book suggests), you've got problems.Regarding the actual text, the book is too long (only Chapters 4-9 are needed, the rest is self-referential filler), too general, and written condescendingly in an annoying office-speak lingo that will make anyone who actually *does* work for a living (ie: not management) cringe.If your path to inner bliss involves relying on your CPA to remind you when to purge your tax archives so you can free up your mind to relax with a glass of chardonnay by your koi pond at sunset, then you'll love this book.","Some useful information, but not that great of a book","December 27, 2008",2.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHFGN3OS3SEN6R65LSELUAYCPMRA,B.

"News flash! Everyone is overwhelmed at work and home. Too much to do. Not enough time. Emails flood the inbox. Interruptions are interrupted by interruptions. Constant pressure.  The office has become the ER.  Do you need a time management workshop--or a sabbatical? Neither says David Allen, who quotes Kerry Gleeson, ""This constant, unproductive preoccupation with all the things we have to do is the single largest consumer of time and energy.""Warning---this book has a radical answer, but it's not for the timid.  The author writes, ""No software, seminar, cool personal planner, or personal mission statement will simplify your workday or make your choices for you as you move through your day, week, and life. What's more, just when you learn how to enhance your productivity and decision-making at one level, you'll graduate to the next accepted batch of responsibilities and creative goals, whose new challenges will defy the ability of any simple formula or buzzword-du-jour to get you what you want, the way you want to get it.""Allen adds, ""I can attest that there is no single, once-and-for-all-solution"" to the goal of stress-free productivity.  But...he does have an antidote ""for the imbalance many people bring onto themselves."" The book, he promises, is ""a vaccination against day-to-day fire-fighting (the so-called urgent and crisis demands of any given workday).""Part of his solution is getting it off your mind (so you can live stress-free) and into a system.  Next it's understanding that it's not about time management. ""The real issue is how we manage action.""  Example: Will a task take less than two minutes? Do it.  If more than two minutes: delegate it or defer it. (Allen has a helpful yes/no flowchart for handling ""stuff."")  He uses ""buckets"" terminology. (I like this guy because his system fits perfectly with my book, Mastering The Management Buckets: 20 Critical Competencies for Leading Your Business or Non-profit.) He says you must master the five functions of collection, processing, organizing, reviewing and doing.You'll get the most value out of it when you link up with two or three others on your team and hold yourselves accountable to implement the very practical principles.

"Why Bother?: Maybe you will find it as useful as I have and throw out your todo lists, day planners and scraps of paper on your nightstand. This simply-titled book started something of a revolution in the tame world of personal organization. In the words of an article in Wired, Allen inspired a ""new cult for the information age"".Core ideas: The inspiration for this book was a realization by Allen that until the `information age' most people worked at jobs where achieved tangible outcomes such as building a house, cooking a meal or healing a patient. Today, the typical information worker rarely gets that feeling of accomplishment. Even people working in traditional occupations suffer from this malise: a vague and constant feeling that there is something you need to get done though you are not sure where to start, nor if you are making progress once you do.Allen devised a simple system that allows people to get all of that stuff out of their head. He discourages priority based todo list. A lot of the stuff we worry about is the little stuff, such as the birthday present to buy for a relative or a library book to return. The first step is to throw all of that ""stuff"", no matter how minute or mundane, into a ""bucket"". These are then filed into folders with tangible, well-defined outcomes, thrown away or saved for reference. There is a lot more to his system and Wikipedia does a fairly good job of explaining it.

"I've read (or at least tried to read) several self-help type books, and most of them are decidedly unhelpful. And I've realized that all this time the thing lacking in self-help literature was advice at the every-day, mundane, workaday level of getting things accomplished. That is what this book provides.There is a ton of specific advice on how to organize your life so that you can operate smoothly and without (much) stress. It is certainly an oversimplification to say that simply writing things down will make it easy to live a stress-free, hyper-productive life. After reading the book and implementing most of the suggestions, I still find myself procrastinating on things from time to time, I still feel anxiety over large projects that are hanging over my head. Regardless of how much you plan things and write them down, if you have large volumes of work undone I think some stress is inevitable. So I wouldn't call my new lifestyle stress-FREE, but definitely REDUCED-stress.To the people that see this book as being a product of our ""consumer culture"" or our obsession with productivity, I say that that is exactly what this book is intended to remedy. There is no escaping the new, high-tech, ever-changing culture we live in. Unless you are willing to isolate yourself from the modern world, ideas like those found in this book are becoming more and more necessary to actually get important work done and not severely damage your mind with stress. Furthermore, by becoming somewhat of a control-freak for every-day details, paradoxically you are able to live a more harmonious, relaxed, and spontaneous life. This is the message of the book that I think some people are missing, based on some of the negative reviews.Of course, as with most books like this, there is a lot of excess verbiage and story-telling.

"This book was written in 2001, so unfortunately it covers none of the cool new web and software tools that are available to us today.The meat of the book is the first half. And it's good stuff, so take notes. The last half is very windy, going on and on with no overall structure (my main complaint with the book).The main points of the book could be written in 10 pages, so be prepared to sit down and really get into this book to glean the best material. **This book is a hard read.** And after reading for 2 hours, you'll find so much information in your head that you'll be craving for a Review or Here's What You've Learned summary. But he doesn't offer it.

"After reading through this book a few times, subscribing to several blogs related to GTD, and trying several GTD applications I came to the following conclusion: The problem isn't so much that we have a lot of things to do.  The problem is figuring what your life goals and priorities are.  When you decide what the important things are in your life, work, and at home, you'll find that you'll be able to manage life as you'll see that there are less things to do.  This will cut out the 'fat' and life won't seem so overwhelming.  My main criticism of the GTD method is that it is very passive and defensive.  What I mean by this is that it encourages passivity as you are bombarded by things that you have to do.  Some of those things are important; some are not.  Nonetheless, you are at the center of life, passively receiving things that you need to do.  In essence, you are not in control of your life but life itself controls you; thus, you are never in the offensive mode, controlling your life.  Having said that, there are some good points to the book, but one should keep what I said in mind as you read/implement the tenets of this book.  Hopefully, I will have saved you a lot of time so that you wouldn't take the path that I took and thereby having more time in getting some important things done.",GTD based on misguided assumptions,"October 21, 2008",2.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGVY4ODJRFOWIUR4AZTZIGDBBFEQ,Yoon Lee
"The book's intro statement says it all. ""It's possible for a person to have an overwhelming number of thigns to do and still function productively with a clear head and a positive sense of relaxed control."" I'm sure most of us feel like we have too many things to do. I know I do! This book purports to help us manage that list with calm and patience.David Allen emphasizes that getting wound up and stressed rarely helps anyone. Atheletes and martial artists know that the best results come when you are ""in the flow"" - when you move effortlessly with what is going on, giving your full focus to the task in a calm, deliberate way.The first step is to document all the projects you have, whatever they are. There are a variety of systems out there - choose whichever works best for you. We are all different humans, we all have different styles. Prioritize them based on their real import to your values, not by any external measure. Figure out, for each project, what a ""next step to do"" would be - something small and manageable. Then start doing them!Too many people have lists with generalities on it like ""go on a vacation"". That is too big a project to tackle! Instead how about having an action item of ""figure out top 3 destination choices"". That is much more easy to handle - and fun, too! Heck, you could do that on a laptop during commercials.The book has actual workflow diagrams helping you see how to sort incoming email, how to organize daily tasks, and more. It is all about sorting, recording what needs to be done and then getting started on the priority items.  The book lists brainstorming ideas, and setting out stages of larger projects. It emphasizes the importance of weekly reviews, to keep yourself on track and to realize how much progress you're making.There is a LOT of information jammed into this book. I definitely recommend reading it in stages - and then going back and re-reading it to glean additional bits of information later on. Like most books of this ilk, it's likely you know 80% of it already. Still, something in that 20% might be EXACTLY what you need to really make a huge improvement in your life.Well recommended.",Multitude of Great Tips,"October 18, 2008",HALL OF FAME,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHHY4XGQ6YJW6H5MBKBSFHMGENFA,Lisa Shea

"Management begins with self! Start managing yourself and you would be able to manage everyone and everything around you. But there are times when you have lots of things to do and you are left with no choice but to get more and more confused.The best ways I thought to manage everything starting from my desktop to the projects I was working in was (after I analyzed a lot and Googled around) to more and more equip myself with sophisticated gadgets, this is what they are meant for, isn't it?. Well after I installed good software, mindmaping applications, get good PDAs, I was, once more, to my surprise managing additional stuffs that what I already was previously. At least for few days I was feeling a little satisfied that my investment in one of the most updated software or a hand-held device is going to bring me peace. But after few weeks everything was back to square one.I even saw this occasionally with other people, the more unorganized you feel the more devices, gadgets, etc you tend to buy, but no one was happy, eventually the more STUFF you get the more unorganized you become. Which ultimately leads to stress. That is NOT the solution. Basically, after getting myself acquainted with GTD I understood that the devices were actually built around GTD. So, once I know what the basis principles of personal productivity are I can accordingly arrange myself, my mailbox, gadgets etc.The solution is to know and understand the CORE the basic principles that are essential to generate productivity and efficiency. You must be a person with great ideas and already very successful, however, if you are someone who is under stress of not being able to manage a lot of stuff then you need this book.Know exactly what stress is? How your internal commintment, even when you think that you are not committing, to various things around you build more and more stress? How can you arrange, discard, delegate stuff.This truly is, as coined by David, an Advanced Common Sense.There is a lot of stuff about GTD over the internet including the 43 folders website.

"I am so inspired by this book!  My filing system at work and at home has never worked as efficiently as it does now, after reading this book.  Author David Allen's detailed system helps clear the 'clutter' in my mind as I have adopted his system of writing down what needs to get done  so the task is either written on my calendar or on my to-do list.  I don't have to try to ""remember"" what I need to do next, wasting time and energy thinking and getting lost in my thoughts.

"First, I want to say that I'd listened to the audio book of this years ago. And at the time it didn't resonate with me AT ALL. Frankly I'm not sure I finished the audio--but either way I couldn't remember any of it other than it was in my library.Fast forward a couple years.. I adopted Tim Ferris' 4HWW method of listing tasks on an 8 1/2 x 11"" sheet of plain paper. That worked great for me for a while. While I'm a tech guy, I like things that are effective, work anywhere, don't require batteries, etc.I then wanted to--as David says: ""Get off the runway"" with my tasks and start managing with a more project/goal/initiative-centric approach. To me that was a big problem with the ""tasks"" approach--you get buried in ""to do"" stuff and never get above the trees.Additionally, in my situation I had huge leakage in delegating or following up with other people with my requests, questions, etc. So the process for handling emails that required responses alone has radically altered how I work and manage my own time.I recently finished GTD and it was like an epiphany. During the first 1/3 of the book though I felt like ""okay, I got the preaching--how do I *implement* this"", and actually purchased/read other systems in the middle. Ultimately coming back to and finishing this book. I'm very happy that I did.In my opinion, you should take what works for you from the book and integrate it with your life/style. For me the 43 folders didn't make sense as I am so nomadic with my work. But it is a good concept. For me, everything has to be electronic and ideally live out on the internet cloud somewhere. So naturally some of my tools will be different than his. But the *system* is what's key.The gold is simply getting you to see ""stuff"" coming into your life as things that need to be processed from your Inbox (the goal being Inbox Zero), and an effective system of processing, then handling things once they're organized.Also, I like how there aren't any ""special"" requirements, like you have to buy a special organizer, get certain software, buy their printed pages, etc. I am currently using a $7 calendar/organizer (with cool doodling) and $15/year for the ""pro"" version of Toodledo (the base version is free). It also has ""slim"" web access via iPhone.. so I can access my lists from practically anywhere. Well worth it to organize my life.Again, for me this has been life-altering.

"Having heard so much about this management system, I read the book--what a frustrating experience!  I was hooked from the beginning and implemented a couple of suggestions with a large party I was then planning and Mr. Allen's suggestions certainly helped me define the ultimate purpose for my party and next actions, and I became much more effective in my preparations.  But then I got on to Chapter 3 and following and totally bombed:  had I not read this already?  And what about these meaningless quotes in the margins that are so distracting?  It only got worse and worse as I read on and I became so stressed about all my unfinished business that I lost sleep!  I knew from my first experience that there were pearls of wisdom in this book, so I started from the beginning again and discovered that all your really need to read and implement is Chapter 2.  So I set up my office as described (without the label maker, I don't need another tool to clutter my desk, and computer-generated labels work very well).  Then I started collecting my STUFF and put it in my inbox, mind you, not all of it at once as he recommends, that's what was stressing me out so much.  Then I started processing what was in my inbox, and adding to it anything I come across (thoughts or physical stuff).

"As with most books like this, a great deal of the content is common sense. But as is always the case with me, formalizing it and explaining it is always what I need.He explains the natural thought process of a project in order to help you get a grasp of what things need to be done in order to achieve your outstanding goals.He explains why you can't ever relax because you have so much to do, and how to get over that stress so that you can relax during those times you want to relax!He gives you a system, which you can use as-is or tailor to your personal taste, that essentially guarantees that nothing gets lost, everything gets done and puts you in control.I know it sounds like an ad, but as I started with, the content is true and makes sense.Admittedly, I'm still pretty new at this system, and have to improve how I work with it, but so far I am loving it.Also, if you have a BlackBerry, look for the ""NextAction!"" software. It's not great software, but it's good enough to follow the system. The main thing that I don't like about the NextAction! is that I find it difficult to manage the tasks in Microsoft Outlook, so I have to stick with Outlook to manage my mail-based tasks and my BB for my non-mail based tasks, but that's not too bad for me.",Defniitely worth the buy,"August 15, 2008",4.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AER2L5KEXH7HHJLDMCS6KUS2GYNQ,David Logan

"GTD called it right when it identified broken agreements with self as a source of negative feeling, anxiety, guilt and ""disintegrated self-trust"". And one cannot be wholly productive when they are nagged by worries of open loops. GTD presents a methodology for remedying this and achieving a ""mind like water"".While I still believe in traditional time management principles such as task prioritization, GTD offers some excellent concepts and takeaways: Corralling all your stuff is critical - you can only feel good about what you're not doing ONLY when you know what you're not doing; the notion of Next Actions is simple but invaluable; separating reference and support material from actionable items will keep the system less clogged; the Someday/Maybe list as an outlet for off-the-wall and future tasks; and the four criteria model for choosing actions in the moment works, among others.GTD makes a strong case for some type of time management or personal organization system. This was my second time through the book and while it was worth the revisit, I wish it gave more specifics on tools; and the lack of mention of Blackerrys and iPhones nearly make the book dated. GTD doesn't offer a panacea; but as David Allen himself states, no system is perfect for tracking projects and tasks, you just need to know you have them and where to find more information.

"The workflow David Allen presents in Getting Things Done is incredibly useful.  So much so, in fact, that it can make the book difficult to read.  I personally started the book twice, only to put it back on the shelf half-completed, before reading it completely on my third attempt.In the interest of getting things done, the book is written in such a way that unfinished business will be drawn out of your subconscious to occupy your central thought process.  Unfortunately, this mental burden distracts attention from reading the book itself.During my first two attempts, this became so frustrating that I simply had to stop reading the book.  However, I was still able to take away valuable lessons.  One of the primary tenets of GTD, is ensuring these reminders get written down in a trusted system.  In so doing, the nagging voice in your head will subside, allowing you to focus and complete tasks efficiently.I began by integrating the ideas I had read into my own way of working.  In so doing, I was able to reach a level where I could finally pick up the book and read it in its entirety, without having my concentration broken by reminders of my open loops.If you are looking to improve your productivity, I highly recommend this book.

I've been through much of the generic ""Time Management"" material, including most of Brian Tracey and others like Rita Emmett's ""Procrastinator's Handbook"".  It's much different than the generic ""A-B-C prioritizing"" / ""important but not urgent"" concepts.  Mr. Allen's system is simple, yet comprehensive and presented in a business-oriented fashon (but it works remarkably well for both personal and business application).

"I got this book at the same time as Getting Organized: Improving Focus, Organization and Productivity in the hope that one or both would help me tame my crazy life as a middle manager in a software company.  Both books have something to offer - in my review of Getting Organized, I suggested skimming or reading several books and articles and taking the best suggestions from each.While ""Getting Organized"" takes a Cliff's Notes approach with two-page chapters that take about two or three minutes each to digest, Getting Things Done goes more in depth, almost to a fault.  I found that the first few chapters of Getting Things Done were much better written than the other book, and also stayed more technology-neutral, leaving it to the reader to decide whether to use paper files, day planners, PDAs, or list management software.As others have written, the ""processing stuff"" flowchart that appears early on (page 32) is worthy of being printed, framed and sat on your desk for daily reference.  It's the best summary I've seen of the different types of input items we all deal with and the choices we can and should make when dealing with them.There's also a lot of meaty stuff that encourages you to think about your  work habits and how you segment your time:  Right now, am I categorizing input items or am I working on individual items?  What's my energy level and mood right now and how should that affect what I do next?  Do I have five minutes free or a solid hour?I'm still developing my system, but essentially I use a combination of list management software (the excellent Remember the Milk) and email/calendaring (Gmail and Outlook) to keep track of things.  I have one list per major area of responsibility (""Home - Finance"", ""Home - Medical"", ""Work - Management"", ""Work - Project xx"", etc.) and I add things to the lists as I think of them.  The author of the other book (Getting Organized) kind of pooh-poohs making huge to-do lists, but personally I agree with David Allen that getting that stuff out of your mind and into a list management system is key to being able to relax and pick what area to work next.  You don't have to ever *do* every list item - in fact, trying to ""finish"" all your lists just isn't possible and the last list item is always ""die a peaceful death"" - but you should at least brainstorm it out once to clear your head.  Usually the first time you do this you end up with 200 or so items - that's ok.Now that I have my lists created, I make sure to spend some time each morning deciding not which items to complete that day, but which list(s) to focus on.  I might block out a solid hour using Outlook to work on management or HR items, and another hour to catch up on email.  When that  ""meeting with myself"" pops up, I just go to the related list and grab the top priority item from the list - that way no area of focus gets starved.I also like Allen's rule about Doing It Now if it takes two minutes or less, but I'd add the caveat that it's possible (for me at least) to find enough two-minute tasks to fill a whole day.  So I would time-box it: spend 30 minutes doing as many 2-minute items as you can, then do something bigger.I haven't finished the book yet, as I've already found plenty of things to try and am finding success, but that's ok.  If you buy this don't feel duty-bound to read every last word the first week.

"This book was practical and useful for me at home.  I love the ""tricks"" that Allen teaches in this book and have been using them for about two weeks. I am doing the things I always knew I should be doing. Having it all out of my head has made a big difference for me. I have used many other systems and have kept the big picture parts of those systems because Allen says this system is about the nitty-gritty, actually getting things done, but you still need the big picture tools.I am starting a new job and I feel as though my life is organized enough NOT to have to worry about what I am leaving undone. After 7 years of full time school, I had 4 garbage bags of paper in my overstuffed file drawer. Now, I remember the lesson, if you have it but can't find it, what's the point of having it? This helps me to know what to keep and what to toss.

"David Allen's book ""Getting Things Done"" is the center of a cult. And cult, in this instance, is not a pejorative - it's a compliment.  Allen has written a classic book on approaching life.  Write everything down. Sort it. Do some things immediately, do some later. Everything must be out of your mind and on a list.  It sounds so simple - and it is so difficult to consistently put into practice.  Allen is, in my opinion, something approaching a genius. If not a genius, then a very bright man who has glimpsed the way to making your life, as he says, productive without stress.

"As someone who has unsuccessfully tried numerous products and methods to get organized -- from the overly involved FranklinCovey system to Julie Morgenstern's Organizing from the Inside Out series, to various other organizational self-help tomes -- this book helped me change my life dramatically and once and for all. Other reviewers have already asserted here the finer points of the system. There are just a few points I want to add.First, you can adapt ""GTD"" to pretty much any way you want to work. This is especially suited to creative types who would otherwise eschew more corporate solutions that tend to be very structured. With a couple of exceptions, you don't need to purchase a specific product or type of system; you could use any of kind of planner (FranklinCovey, DayRunner, etc.), but you could also use a stack of index cards held together with a binder clip. Or a Moleskine notebook. Or Post-It notes strung together with rubber bands. It's your choice. You can be creative with this system. You can even adjust the different procedures involved, depending on your needs. Many people have successfully created their own planners for GTD. (In fact, there's a whole slew of Internet sites dedicated to freely downloadable templates for such DIY planners.)The products that David Allen does recommend are: (1) a good-quality file cabinet, (2) a label-making machine, (3) manila file folders (instead of hanging file folders), and of course (4) certain types of office supplies, such as staplers, rubber bands, etc.In my own personal experience, I've found that having a label-making machine has been invaluable. And I really like the used Steelcase file cabinet I bought for $125.The most common complaint about David Allen's recommendations is his bias AGAINST using hanging file folders in favor of manila folders, but most people who prefer to use hanging files do so anyway. (I'll tell you -- it's somewhat difficult these days to find file cabinets with a so-called spring-loaded follower block, which allows you to stand manila folders up by themselves in the cabinet.)Second, anyone who criticizes GTD for being ""obvious"" or ""simple common sense that doesn't need to be explained in a book"" has missed the point entirely. GTD works precisely because it is based on common sense techniques that many people have been using for years. The beauty is that its intended audience are those who do not understand how to enact the simple organizational measures that their more organized peers intuitively understand. (When I described GTD to a friend of mine, he affirmed that he'd been using pretty much the same techniques for years with great success and without having known of or read ""Getting Things Done."") I suppose the worst you could accuse David Allen of is being the first person to actually write down common-sense techniques for organizing oneself.Third, if you plan to buy this book and adopt this system, you should be aware of the huge online presence of others who have done the same. David Allen's and Merlin Mann's websites are just two examples; there's a large online family of people out there who love and use GTD, exchanging ideas, methods, products, etc. In other words, not only is GTD tweakable for your own ends, but you'll have lots of people to talk to about it too.Update as of August 2, 2008: Reviewers of the GTD system here and elsewhere have suggested the GTD system has cultish aspects. I think it's important to note that, as with anything, it's easy to take the GTD system too far. Many of the online forums centered on the GTD system are helpful in terms of allowing practitioners to trade tips and tricks, but there is a subculture here that gets extreme. I'm talking mainly about people who just take the system too literally, who simply don't do a single thing unless it's written in one of their lists. For example, someone initiated a thread on David Allen's forum soliciting advice on how to use list-tracking during an emergency. Call me crazy, but it seems to me that pausing during an emergency to make a list (!) is the antithesis of being productive.That said, I still think there's an enormous amount of value to the GTD system. Use it for what it's worth. Some people on these forums would have you believe it's important to track your bathroom visits in a list. Don't use it for anything else, or take it to extremes.",Common sense put into words (but be careful of the cultish aspects),"April 20, 2008",5.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFSDGTWXF5Q7HGYPAUBGQ2VBJ32A,Michael

Besides being eco un-friendly, I find that paper files create clutter and clutter is stressful.Real solutions to productivity do not come from filing systems.  The problem isn't necessarily your disorganization.  Usually the problem is that you have too much work assigned to you.  Solutions to being overworked:1.  Delegate, delegate, delegate!2.  Talk to your manager about hiring more employees3.  Eliminate wasteful tasks4.  Find a new job (seriously)5.  Simplify your life outside of work.  Buy less, shop less, and spend your time with friends/family.  Go outside and exercise.  Turn off the TV and go to bed an hour early.  Eat healthy foods.

"David Allen's premise (which is a good one) in ""Getting Things Done - The Art Of Stress Free Productivity"", is that the skills needed to become more productive are not new to us.  We know how to do the things we need to do.  It's more a matter of making a commitment, jumping in, and then having a system to ensure we keep it up.  Allen helps us on all three challenges.On making a commitment Allen provides ample and simple concepts, case scenarios and a good dose of common sense.  The introduction and chapter one should provide enough push to get anyone started.  For example, he suggests that for everything we think we need to do (or get done) we should:* Clarify the intended outcome - ""What do we really want to achieve?""* What's the next physical action needed to move us toward the outcome?* Then, to maintain our commitment, put both the outcome and actions into a system - one that works for us (not a ""one size fits all"" approach)I liked this book.  It is well written and easy to follow.  Everything he says makes sense.  I particularly liked the core concept diagram which was repeated at the appropriate places throughout the book.  What's most important in a book like this, is that Allen provides enough tools, concepts and techniques for anyone to become more productive.  As a reviewer of a self-help book, it's a good sign that I have implemented some of Allen's suggestions.

"I heard about this system on NPR. They said hi-tech junkies were hooked on its low tech system of organizing 'your life'. So, I read it. At first, it seemed like another one of those books aimed squarely at managers and the clueless laptop bearing execu-troids that I support in my job. The language is vague and feels like an infomercial when you read it. There is a lot of name dropping and I can see where it would appeal to the people who make the entire IT department go to a big meeting to watch the video version of ""Who Moved My Cheese"" right before they start the big round of lay-off's.But as I read it, I began to see through the fog of seminar speak and distill some gems of functionality. There's gold in that there double-talk! (If you're willing to dig for it.)I just finished reading the book. Now I'm going back through it in order to simplify the information and work up a system I can handle. Which, to be fair, the author advises. There are plenty of places in the book where he says you can modify the system so it meets your specific needs. He goes into way too much detail on trivial points and leaves out some things that I think need clearing up. You can figure out what he meant if you read it a few times and refer back to earlier passages as you go.I like the part where you get everything out of your head and on paper or recorded somewhere. I have plenty of ideas that I forget about then have to figure out again later. I like the Next Actions list and the ""Tickler File"" / Calendar that you can use to remind yourself about things you might be interested in later but don't have time to think about right now. I LOVE the 2 minute rule. I started applying that the second I read it and already my life has improved.  I like the part where you get rid of junk that you don't need lying around anymore. But, I don't think there will ever be a 'delegate' box on my flowchart. That's where I think it's aimed at managers rather than people who actually work.I want to give the ""GTD"" system 4 stars and the actual book 3 stars because of all the double talk and repetitiveness. If you are someone who needs this system you'll love it, if not, you'll hate it. In regard to earlier reviewers who commented on it changing their life (or not). This book is about ""Getting things done"" not about meditation. It's about productivity. (Whatever that means.)

"First off, what I didn't like about the book"":* too long; I felt he had about 30% too much content in there.  Chapters 4 - 10 are ""the meat"", with Chapters 11 -1 3 providing the next level of useful detail.* the first 3 chapters could either be significantly trimmed or eliminated* the margin quotes interspersed throughout the book were interesting to read, but I found them distracting and not really adding a lot to comprehension of the content (I like reading quotes from people, and gather that Robert Allen does as well...)That said...I strongly recommend this book for people who really want to get ""their lives"" under control.

"I realize a lot of people have given this book a 5-star review, however I was very disappointed in it.  I have read five or six time management books in the past week as research for a class.  This one in particular had several flaws, in my opinion.  This is not a time management book that would be useful for everyone.  It does address projects that could apply at home, but there is never the sense that the author is aware of the daily chores that take up so much time - such as laundry, dishes, grocery shopping, etc.  He encourages more ways to do office work at home on and on weekends.  At one point he actually says that some of his most stressed clients are the ones who work all day, then have to go home and deal with their spouse and screaming children, and they are lucky if they have a long commute.  I was very disappointed and somewhat shocked to read that!  Maybe that was because I had just read a different book that was much more geared toward family, and stressed getting the work done so you can focus on your true values and priorities.The book is somewhat hard to follow, because the author offers several different methods rather than just one, and they are mixed throughout the book.  On a positive note, he does address overall organizational methods in the book, as well as time management.",Intended for male executives,"March 3, 2008",2.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEK7XBEBCEOX3A3SBXHI7ES2MDQQ,H.

"I didn't even know that I needed a system to improve my productivity, least my personal productivity. It wasn't until six months ago, while I was choking in my job with lots of unfinished projects that I learnt about lifehacks and productivity systems. I read about the David Allen's GTD, tried some tricks... and they made wonders!Once Amazoned and read, this book hasn't quite changed my life but has taught me neat tricks to manage it better. Nowadays I know what am I doing ( in terms of ongoing job and personal projects), where am I going and which are the next steps that I want to take.The main achievement of the system is to translate the workload of remembering what do you need to do from your mind to an external trusted system (be it a high-tech Palm or a pen-and-paper notebook).The book is well structured, the points are well explained and the language is fresh and near to you. Though I would recommend also to google the gtd as well to learn about particular examples on how different people from different background have modified the system to their own needs.

Rather than providing a ""locked in system"" that requires you to organize in one particular way - using one particular set of tools; this book is much more than that.

"While this book does have some valuable, if not simple, ideas, it is presented in a long-winded fashion which repeats itself.  I ultimately found this book helpful, but think it is overhyped.  My main complaints are:1.  Does not harness information technology:Allen's methods resort to old-fashioned write everything down and put it in a file or pile system.  He actually tells people to print every email in their Outlook account, delete the emails, and then file the paper copies.2.  Paper-based system.  As I just said, printing out every one of your emails to get organized is obviously inefficient--and a huge waste of paper.  This is old thinking applied to new technology, and it doesn't fit.  You could instead teach a system of email folders (and even automatic sorting) to accomplish the same task.3.  This book is long winded.  The principles and practices are simple.  The presentation is not.  It is as if Allen feels he needs us to read everything three times to remember it.In conclusion--there has to be a better way to get organized than this book.

"I prefer not to use big words, but I liked this book because of the way it made me feel: progress in my work became tangible and I psychologically liked that. And I got more things done. I personally liked the good feeling more than the productivity increase (which for me is just a side effect) while my manager noticed the latter - win-win situation!I got inspired to read this book after I attended a workshop about GTD held by my employer - one of David's guys was the trainer. During that time I felt that I could take control of what modern IT life throws at me. The book only strengthened that feeling. David's style is a bit dry at times, but overall it is very easy to read. Most of what he says (or all) is just common sense, but he puts it all together, explaining and encouraging changes.I'll start with the end, more philosophical chapter, and add some ideas of mine. In life there are two major problems:1) we don't know what we want to do2) we don't know how to do something that we want.As he puts it, it's like yin yang from Chinese Taoism - two complementary aspects of the same things. The solutions are:1) make things up2) make things happenEasy! Problem is that most people don't do either of them too well, and feel unhappy most of the time. David is trying to help with these issues as they show up in the life of a modern IT worker.Obviously, he cannot tell you what to want - but he emphasizes Mind Sweep, which is putting all your thoughts on a material support (paper or computer). The book helps mostly - and obviously - with the second part: the making things happen.The mind is for us to master and use, but unless we use it properly it could harm us rather than help. The mind always reminds us of what we need to do. For example, when you see a flashlight in your home your mind tells you ""hey, the batteries inside are drained, let's get buy new ones"", and so on each time you go by the flashlight. The mind is trying to help - indeed batteries are needed. But, what can you do at home? Nothing! It would be nice if the mind would remind you about batteries only when you drive by some store and only at that time - that is only when you can do something about getting batteries. Unfortunately, the mind doesn't work like that. Every time something needs to be changed or done, a part of your mind is tracking that all the time, reminding you about it, consuming a part of your psychic energy. And, as David puts it, most people have around 300 things in their heads that need to be tracked - no wonder that consumes a lot of energy. If you have even two thoughts to track, then the efficiency goes down a lot, let alone when you have 300. What is his solution? The GTD system!And what is the GTD system? It is David's way of getting the mind clear of thoughts, ""mind like water"" as he says inspired by Eastern books, when you get into a state called ""the zone"" by athletes, where focusing is easy and doing things - and getting them done -  comes naturally.As he says, ""you shouldn't have the same thought twice, unless you like that thought"". He emphasizes that you should handle both your work and personal life - any kind of tracking thought needs to get out of the mind.His system has more phases - collect, process, organize, review and do. I won't get into too many details - his book does that and also there are many Internet resources set by GTD enthusiasts. Collect happens at every moment - as you have a thought you put it on a list in your in-basket (physical or a computer list), same if your boss enters your office and tells you about a new work item. Processing happens regularly - twice a day, every two hours, etc. - he doesn't set hard limits. Processing means asking ""what is this actually? Does it have an outcome?"".If the answer is no outcome, it was just a random thought or thing that came at you. The next question - is it actionable? If no, you can trash it, or file it (he explains more systems of filing).David emphasizes actions a lot - the mind will keep quiet only if you get to define an action for that item. If you don't, you will still get reminded like for the batteries case. So, if an action is needed, decide that action (call Joe, email Mary, write report, talk to wife, etc.). ""I need to fix car"" is an item that comes to mind. ""Call repair shop at 555-1234"" is not an item any more, it's an action. Processing and organizing means getting from ""stuff"" to actions. An action could be delegated to someone (an employee, spouse, kids, etc.), deferred (set into a calendar), etc.Some thoughts turn into a project - like house remodeling. Projects are just a set of actions. At any moment you ask - what is the next actions? GTD is a about determining actions and doing them.I will only add the review part - David suggests reviewing all the projects and actions lists weekly and update them accordingly. To quote him, ""that's the time to be creative, to dare"". Do no periodic review and GTD will fail.The system teaches how to handle details, how to do things. GTD starts at the bottom, ""at the runway"" (per the book), it doesn't make you ask yourself what your purpose in your job, career, family and life in general - there are other books for that. David Allen beliefs that once you know how to do things you will automatically gain confidence and ask yourself those higher questions, but it doesn't work the other way around like other similar books suggest.All in all, if in your life there are many events that change things often (e.g. you work in IT, etc.) then this is a highly recommended book. Even if you don't it is still worth reading it - everyone has personal projects that need to get done better. Last but not least, getting things done will make you feel good, and nothing can beat that - what can you ask more from a book?",The modern productivity bible,"December 13, 2007",5.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHENVOU2TNOYDJ44NE446UUKUY2A,Adrian S.
"I'm only semi-organized by nature.  I'm one who can find most things, most of the time.  I don't miss many deadlines.  However, when it happens that I can't find something, can't remember a task that is right on the fringe of my conscious brain or realize that something I should have done was overlooked, I have to ask myself what I'm doing wrong.  Well, this book answered my questions.David Allen has shown me the error of my ways.  He reveals that not being in control by way of an organized system is stressful and destructive.  If your mind isn't free of all the ""need-to-do"" items in your life, you become stressed and you also waste energy better used on the task at hand.  After he explained it, it seemed like such a ""well.. duh!"" concept.  Why didn't I think of that?  In essence, I have been sabotaging myself and my goals.His next step is to guide you through the process of setting up a very useful and very workable system.  Finally, he teaches you how to use the system.  Getting through the initial steps (putting things in order) can seem to be fair amount of work but will vary depending on how organized you are already.  In my case, it's going to be a lot of work unfortunately.I've recently started using his system.

And, I get lost on occasion and have to return to his book and re-read a short section.  I'm getting it down though and am happily witnessing results.I plan to read the entire book again since the first time through has been so helpful for me.  It really is all about training (or re-training) yourself and developing a little discipline.  It's NOT complex, just different.  Bottom line... it works.As a final note, I'll confess to completely ignoring one of David's suggestions.  He advocates the absence of hanging file folders.

"This is a very, very good book and if you're looking for something to really help make a difference in your life, this is probably a very good place to start.First, there is no substitute for self-discipline if you want to change your life. Too many self-help books fail to acknowledge this point. There are plenty of ""systems"" that work, if you have the self-discipline to follow through. Most self-help books and motivational speakers will get you ""juiced up"", but then it's up to you. But... those self-help books never addressed the self-discipline problem, did they?This book focuses on specific elements of self-discipline, although you still need to be disciplined to follow through.On the down-side, I believe this book is far too long and detailed. A tough editor could eliminate a third to a half of it in my view. David Allen, while an exceptionally helpful and positively intentioned human being, is clearly quite a left-brain dominant character, and some of his right-brain discussions are so layered with left-brain detail that they become fuzzy. Don't fuss yourself when it gets fuzzy - just read on.On the up-side, Allen separates himself from so many productivity and motivational gurus specifically because there is a lifetime's worth of practical, one-to-one, this-is-what-actually-happens-in-the-trenches knowledge in this book.This book is not perfect. But in my view it's more likely to be directly helpful to more people than the vast, vast majority of ""do this to improve your life"" titles on the market.Be prepared to put aside a full week about four to six weeks from the day you buy this book. Then buy this book and read it once through. Then, just before you get to the full week that you've put aside, start again at the start and go for it.You'll still need your own self-discipline.

"I was given this book by my business partner, whose wife recommended it to him.  After having tried Franklin planners and Day Timers over the years I was a bit skeptical, especially since I wasn't looking for a new productivity system.  Boy was I wrong!  This is the most productive system I've ever used.  I also bought the white paper from his website showing in detail how to implement this in Outlook.  He teaches practical processes that work.  I've been using GTD for about six months now and I love it.  I am much more productive than I've ever been and things don't fall through the cracks.  One of the things I love about this process is that it can be implemented with a variety of tools - not just proprietary tools like those from Franklin.  Franklin sells overpriced appointment calendars.  I've taken their courses but found the implementation of their process impractical.  The basic premise of GTD - that you need to track everything and must be able to respond to changes immediately - works for the reality of my business environment.

"This is the bible of productivity books, but the best thing about it is that just by *reading* it you will walk away with a better life (IMHO).You can go as far down the rabbit hole of tuning your productivity systems as far as you want, but just knowing the basic premise that *writing down* every little task you need to do as soon as you identify it will automatically make you more productive and, more importantly, *reduce your stressing about things*.The first time I read this book months ago, I started using simple todo lists more when my schedule got hectic - thats all.

"#1 if you are not already naturally organized, then I can only expect you will toss this book in the rubbish bin because his process would be excruciating torture to you. It is an in-depth, deep clean.If you are already naturally organized and yet feel you are not truly maximizing the effort you are putting into it, then this is well worth the time to read.I easily related to this book and took away a few productive processes. It is over all a helpful book on organizing beyond the ubiquitous to do list. He has clear steps to get stalled projects moving forward. Hammering the point that the frustrations you face in getting things done are in actuality your lack of dealing with the hard question of what is the next physical action I need to take with this to deal with it. That may very well be toss it in the rubbish or Make a phone call...Unfortunately, more often than not his example of the next action step is make a call... I started to cringe half way through the book whenever he wrote ""Finally, when it's time to actually do an action, LIKE MAKING A CALL..."" Towards the end of the book I was saying out loud and laughing ""What is our next action step... Oh, of course make a call!""That one criticism aside, I am trying his tickler file concept and do find it useful. I have implemented his mind sweep to organizing myself before the week so as to be prepared to face all of the inevitable interruptions and schedule changes with ease while accomplishing my weekly objectives.

"David Allen's concise and useful guide is built largely on the idea that, while people ""think"" in terms of entire projects, human action can only be practically applied to one aspect of a project at any one time.In order to be effective, and work intelligently,we must first diligently construct our catalog of things that ""need"" doing and then proceed to priortize them in terms of their relative importance. This is only list making, however the act of breaking each project down, in order of importance, into discrete action steps is a more complex intellectual process, and is where we often fail. It is not a complex concept, but even the very intelligent lose sight of it under the pressures of life and work.I found it interesting that many of the key points emphasized by Allen were articulated by Earl Nightingale, a famous radio commentator, decades ago. They are no less true today.

"While the abridged audio CD version of Getting Things Done makes a perfect refresher tool for those who read the full book originally, too much detail and background is missing for this to be someone's first introduction to the GTD method of time management. Unfortunately, the unabridged audio won't be widely available until 2008.Overall, the GTD system has a lot to offer. It's ""open source"" and ""platform-independent,"" meaning you can use as much or as little of it as you want and adapt it to whatever organizational system you already like or are forced to use by circumstance--Outlook, FranklinCovey, 3x5s, whatever. Yes, it pretty much comes down to making a to-do list, but GTD's approach adds the subtle differences that make the lists actually effective reminders and trackers, rather than an overwhelming mess o' stuff to get done.

"David Allen's book Getting Things Done is the best time-management system I have come across--and I have learned and used several over a period of well over 30 years, both during a career and now while retired.  This is time-management on steroids.  The writing is clear and enjoyable to read.  Also, Allen gives in his book and audio CDs plenty of examples and analogies that clarify his points.  His system has obviously been perfected over the years of his teaching in seminars as well as practicing it himself.  There are many phrases that capture the essential principles and ideas meaningfully, precisely, and memorably.Allen takes time-management (this title doesn't do it justice, maybe ""life-management"" would  be closer, or ""Life by Design"") to a higher level of intelligence and effectiveness.  Even to call this work well-thought-out is an inadequate compliment: For It contains powerful tools that have been refined in the furnace of experience, both the teacher's and his students'.  This is a system of getting things done that will, applied consistently, be effective in any work situation, or at home, or during school.  Yet it is not rigid or oppressive, but flexible and under your control.If you want your life to be more than a meandering, haphazard experience; if you want to do something with your life that counts, that achieves something, that makes a difference; or, if you just want or need to get a lot done without overwhelming yourself and stressing yourself unnecessarily, I highly recommend this book.",Time-management on steroids,"August 22, 2007",5.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGTMWVLX5Y3LRKD5XAZPDP2WCAAQ,Amazon Customer

"We all have too much to do, but most of us could be completing much more if we learned to stop worrying so much about not getting things done. David Allen makes the point that we have all these tasks (""unfinished loops"") in our mind that keep us from attacking and completing our work with clarity. We need to identify all of our tasks (yes, every single one), and make sure they are cared for in some way (discarded, scheduled for later, immediately addressed, etc.) by our ""system"" so we are not burdened by them and can concentrate on the task at hand.Adhering to the ""system"" that David recommends requires discipline. Those not used to planning will shudder at some of the suggestions, but there is no doubt that if implemented and executed properly, productivity improvement will result.I personally favor Covey's First Things First time management approach which I believe achieves the same freeing effect, while ensuring focus is placed on the most important tasks.

"The book that launched a movement.First, I must confess that I originally read this book in 2001 when it was originally published.  I found that life-changing.  I must also confess that this is a review written by a guy whose personalized car at license tags read, ""GTD GUY.""With that said, I wanted to revisit the book six years after publication and give it a fresh read to see if it stood up to the passage of time.  I found that it did and offers a highly practical approach to getting more done.  David Allen's approach to capturing all the things that you need to do in your life, processing them, and setting up systems to act upon them is an invaluable template for productivity.  He also strongly advocates the weekly discipline of reviewing all of your projects, next actions, and life goals.Some people may find fault with Allen's advocacy of gadgetry, but this is an adjunct to his discussion.  I believe he is correct that people gravitate toward systems and where they find they are tools congenial, whether those tools are high-tech or low-tech.Others may argue that the focus on getting things done puts the emphasis on things, and devalues people and relationships.  I'm not sure that that is a fair criticism of GTD, which has become more than a book but has morphed into a movement.  (In fact, David Allen himself now occupies somewhat of a cult status among productivity geeks.)Nevertheless, Allen would probably argue that when you get more things done, you are relaxed and stress free and can have more time and energy to devote to cultivating important relationships in your life.  GTD does not purport to be a template for solving every problem in your life.  It is merely a tool for getting things done.  Those with a tendency toward workaholism may use or abuse the techniques in GTD to neglect important relationships.  Is that a flaw in the book or a flaw in the personality makeup of the reader?  Perhaps the answer is evident.Six years after publication, GTD remains a bit of a ""Bible"" of personal productivity.

"Getting Things Done action orient method of self-management. by David Allen.Getting things done is an excellent book for increasing productivity by David Allen.He uses the old Japanese adage ""mind like water"" from Karate to describe how our minds best work with relaxation and efficiency.However, we face a conflict in the day to day grind of so many things to do.  Allen's book lays out a plan for a solution.His theory is that you ""get everything out of your head"" and into a ""trusted system"".A trusted system can be a calendar or a planner.But it has to be something that you review on a regular basis.One suggestion which I found immediately useful was the ""2-minute rule"" meaning that if you have something to do that comes up and it will take you 2 minutes or less then you should complete it immediately.I personally chose this book to get organized, reduce the stress associated with many tasks and also to increase my productivity.Allen recognizes that traditional productivity skills and the plethora of organization tools available today are really sufficient for successfully ""getting things done"" in a more organized and less stressful manner.While he recognizes the value of these tools...he argues that there is no device which is a magic bullet for organization.Allen states that the most important thing is our ""action"" and not our thoughts when getting things done.In other words Allen suggests we should do our thinking ahead of time and when getting things done we are action oriented.When we finish one task we have in place a system for simply moving onto the next.Here are a few points from Allen's book'Make decisions about actions required on stuff when it shows up not when it blows up.'Organize reminders of your projects and the next actions on them in appropriate categories.'Keep your system current, complete, and reviewed sufficiently to trust your intuitive choices about what you're doing (and not doing) at any time.""*Create a workflow based on context so that you get things done by action and not relying on the mental reminder but instead relying on a ""trusted system"" of context which leads one to complete the next task at hand with the correct timing. In other words using a system of external support to free your mind of anxiety, worry, and distraction that prevents one from getting things done.* set up a ""trusted system"" that allows you to do the thinking in advance, generate a series of actions which we can later undertake without any further planning and get rid of the mental ""reminder system""* Capture everything that you need to track or remember or act on in what Allen calls a 'bucket': either a physical inbox, email inbox, etc. AllSo why is David Allen so bent on Action?buckets should be processed to empty at least once per week.Why Action is most important' Principles of front end planning that allows a person to  method of categorization and plan of action' Enable the individual to move the ""tasks"" out of ones mind and frees one's mind to attend to the task at hand.' setting up a system of recording them somewhere else in an organized system that will lead to action' Advocates creating lists that are context specific and not completing things based on priority.Overall I rate this book very highly and would suggest it to anyone who is trying to stay efficient and organized!",Getting Things Done,"July 20, 2007",5.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AG3GZ24TXQT6PFXCWHEJJIT4TD3Q,Charles B.
"I'm only about 25% through this book and it has already helped me.  Allen is right that you should replace your vague worrying about things needing done and put it somewhere.  Mine is on paper (in Word), double sided in eight sections so far, and that's what works for me, can take it anywhere to add and cross off.  Half of the sections are work (next action, projects, long term goals) and the other are personal (next actions, projects, home/garden).  I run my own manufacturing company, am a mom of active kids, soccer coach, school volunteer and boyscout leader, so I could use all the help I can get.  Keep the list on my computer and do the weekly review.At first, when I put down the list of things, I was shocked and dismayed at the amount of things that were there being left undone; however, after getting over the shock, I found that things were getting done much better.  Having the lists organized permits me to work on autopilot and make more headway than I otherwise would have.  I can tell that breaking down projects into actionable items is going to be GREAT!  I found out about the book on Lifehacker Geek to Live, a place for excellent tech tips.  I'm making myself read the book every day (don't usually have time for book reading), and I will get things done.Many thanks to David.",Will help organize your overwhelming life,"July 18, 2007",5.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFQQ5QEICI24WMCOHWYHYQVGCIJQ,workingmom
"I'm fairly skeptical of what the latest ""increase your productivity"" fad books that blow through management from time to time.  I've heard about Getting Things Done for a while and I was finally forced by my employer to read it.I would classify this book as useful and pretty no-nonsense.  Essentially the author promotes getting organized so that you don't have background processing going on in your mind about tasks that you haven't delt with yet in some way.  The book is about helping you collect and categorize all these tasks both in your personal and professional life so that they are out of your head and into a system that is external to yourself.  Thus your mind lets go, and if you build your system properly, you can end up getting a lot more done both at work and at home.  I like the books approach of not telling you exactly how to organize your life other then a few concepts that the author has observed working countless times in business environments.  There is a system, but it is loose as long as you focus on a few core concepts (you have to read the book to get those).The book is worth the read and definitely if you have to read some business fad type book, pick this one over others.

"GTD (Getting Things Done) is the martial art of personal productivity management. It teaches you a systematic way to keep projects, tasks, wishes, and ""stuff"" managed in a universal list system, and off your mind. It leaves you free to devote your full attention to the present moment, knowing that everything you ""should be"" taking care of is tracked and WILL be taken care of in time. It allows you the flexibility to change your plans when necessary without losing track of your SHOULDS.I've been using GTD for over 4 years now, and I keep rediscovering its beauty and applicability to new situations. Whenever I feel stressed, or find myself working at less than stellar productivity rates - I find that it's because I've neglected some aspect of the GTD system.David Allen is an excellent communicator, and his system is bullet proof.

"I have taken away more from Getting Things Done than any other time management/ life management book I have ever read.  The reason is simple:  This book is written in a practical way and the applications are therefore easy to implement.  The main point of the book is that if you get things out of your head and into paper, it will clear your mind to think more clearly and be more productive.  I have found this premise to be absolutely true.  I first read the book in 2001 and since then my life is a lot more organized.  I have been using the hanging file system with the labeler that Allen recommends since the very first time I read the book.  I'll admit that I  often (very often, unfortunately) ""fall of the wagon"" and go back to my old habits, but  when I hit the chaos point, I immediately use the system and within a day I have my mind clear to take on my business.  During the years I have recommended this book a number of times and have given away a number of copies.  I have read reviews which indicate that the methods taught by this book have been covered in other books.

"I finally took the ""Next Action"" of studying (not scanning) this widely acclaimed book.  The many ideas and systems described by Allen sound great but, in the end, do not generate a coherent system.  Of the dozens I could cite, I give just two examples.1.  On page 170 he admonishes the reader to not use a categorization of ""Hold and Review"".  One paragraph later he says that anything that one would have put in ""Hold/Review"" should actually go in ""Read/Review""....with no substantive differentiation.2.  The book is replete with instances where Allen creates a proper noun such as ""Someday/Maybe"" and then overlays it with another word ""Incubate""...which sounds an awful lot like ""Hold (incubate?) and Review"".While I did not attempt to do so, my overwhelming impression is that a systematic reconsideration of the system and a rewriting of the book in which every component fits in a coherent way with the next, could turn this into a useful system.","Many great ideas, loosely connected, inconsistently explained","May 10, 2007",2.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AELQGDWD7KABS2I47PRK46BOYDGQ,Ken Florian

"Next to the Bible, this is the most life changing book I've ever read. I find that the back cover of this book (the same description given above) is at best underwhelming and even deceptive. It's deceptive (not on purpose) because it doesn't give enough persuasive information to let you know how fantastic this book is. For the first time in my 19 years of professional life, the top of my desks in both of my offices are clear, there are no stacks of papers and folders on my shelves, things are in order, my mind is clear and I feel a level of optimism and enthusiasm for my (way too many) projects that I've not had in a long time. My colleagues are envious and amazed because I haven't garnered a reputation of being organized, but they see I am.Allen's approach is fairly low tech. While you can use a computer to help you get organized, you can use traditional pencil, paper, folders and file cabinets. He uses the raw materials everyone else uses. But a master artist and I could have the same materials in front of us and he or she will create a work of art while I will create slop. Ordinary office supplies in the hands of Allen's very logical (and easy to maintain) workflow are a work of art. I can't believe how simple this all is, but after 19 years of always trying to get organized, I certainly did not come up with these dynamite workflow habits, so Allen is to be commended.This was the best money I've spent on a book.","Next to the Bible, this is the most life changing book I've ever read . . .","May 7, 2007",5.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEQH6GQOYPCXVOJGTWJKJ7LWXCQQ,David Kilpatrick

Although I am not all the way through my reorganizing process, I am 79% there and making progress, not losing ground, every day. Whether you do everything exactly as he suggests or most of it, this cannot fail you.  Although the CD is abridged, it is enough to apply to almost any situation requiring order and a trusted system to maintain it. The systems he offers are dynamic and can be applied to anything from planning domestic activities to participating in global change. Most of us will benefit enormously and all I can say is, it's a huge relief to have some genuine, unbiased and non-judgemental support, advice and instruction.

"Like many busy professionals whose days are filled with managing ideas, concepts, projects, electronic information, and paper, I've tried for years to find a system for managing the inputs, to-dos, and outputs of my life.  For my physical space (desk, placement of items) I've found that adapting the 5-S principles from Lean Manufacturing works well.  But most of what I do involves non-physical items: thoughts, ideas, information, knowledge, lists, etc.  How does one get handle on all the ""stuff"" in one's life?While most approaches focus on mostly useless concepts like ""prioritization"" and ""things to do today"", David Allen's GTD approach is context-driven.  I do not know if this would work for everyone, but it clearly and irrefutably worked for me.  The other (nearly zen-like) concept of getting things out of one's mind so one can actually think ABOUT them instead of OF them was very eye-opening.  In many ways, GTD takes the 5-S approach to the physical world and translates it to the concepts and constructs that consume our time (i.e. to-dos, projects, next steps, read, file, store, retrieve, appointment, deadlines, etc.)While I am not ever going to be a fanatic, a ""GTD geek"", or look at Mr. Allen as a guru, I am profoundly in debt to the simple, elegant, yet robust concepts presented in this book and look forward to reading his other works and to investigating his web site.  My daily work life is finally manageable in this sense:  prior to GTD, I was overwhelmed and out of control. Today I'm overwhelmed and in control.

"David Allen explains in his book how to get all the things that are clogging up your mind out on notes or lists (either paper, computer, note cards, Palms etc) and in your calendar. By doing this your mind  should become ""like water"" and could focus on one selected task at hand not being distracted by all the other projects looming in the background of the ""RAM"" in your brain. He proposes an elaborate system to order your ""to do's"" and to review the lists keeping them updated and checking on what you have to do.To say it upfront: I love lists, use them all the time and for each purpose and I am working happily with 2 calendars (one for work and one for private life) since almost 30 years. I agree that getting things done is one of the most rewarding accomplishments to feel and to be called ""effective"", and I like many of the ideas from the book like ""mind mapping"" to calm the water after the brain storm, or generating an effective file system. But some of David Allen's suggestions seem even to me a bit overdone. I am afraid that if I would start so many lists and notes as he recommended, I would think about them all the time to not forget to check them all, so that my mind would probably not be ""like water"", but rather like a tsunami. I did not quite understand how the author manages to carry those lists with him on travels without making a list, what lists to take for which occasion. What if I am unexpectedly stuck in traffic and would have time to work on my ""to call"" list, but did not take it with me? My mind is blank (like water) and I would not know how to effectively fill the time.So, while I don't agree that it makes a lot of sense to rely on this ""external brain"" I agree that it helps tremendously to write things down.

"GTD is an excellent book and well worth reading by anyone who is interested in personal productivity and personal effectiveness. There are two key points that make this a four-star vs. five-star review:1. The book has a serious layout or design problem: the ""inspirational quotations"" in the margins often hinder the reading flow as they push into the space occupied by the main text. The quotes distract the reader from the main text due to their intrusion into such and a lack of white space. IMO, there are too many inspirational quotes. Allen should have simply started each chapter with one relevant quote, ala Covey's ""7 Habits..."" I've noticed that some of the inspirational quotes in GTD are recycled in Allen's other book, ""Ready for Anything"" (RFA), which suffers even more from this design issue. To see how to place quotes or references in the margins of a book's pages, Allen should review any of Edward Tufte's books, such as ""Beautiful Evidence.""2. While Allen's focus in GTD is on getting one to clear their mind by better managing their commitments (operational, in-the-trenches, being in the moment), it is very light on ""The Vision Thing"" -- the big picture, the longer horizon, which is critical to one's life. He does attempt to address this in one of the later chapters, and to some degree in the essays in RFA. Anyone who reads GTD should also read Stephen Covey's ""The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People"" and ""First Things First."" Combined with GTD, the knowledge one obtains can make a powerful difference in one's life. Additionally, Peter Drucker's ""The Effective Executive"" is required reading for anyone interested in GTD and involved in ""knowledge work.""",An excellent book despite a somewhat flawed layout,"March 13, 2007",4.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFNBYLFZQX6RQKUANZFU54PI7S4A,G.

"Two weeks ago I read and immediately implemented the process that David Allen outlined in his book and I'm already reaping the benefits. Before reading the book I actually considered myself fairly organized, but I didn't realize how blind I was to the 'nooks and crannies' of my stuff: stubborn undone tasks, books promised-to-get-read yet never do, things that get piled in a corner waiting for . . . ; you know what I'm talking about. They get lodged and lost in the shuffle. But Allen's book helped me to take off the blinders and 'put everything into IN (the IN box)', literally! He actually recommends getting and using an in box! Believe me, before I didn't have one, but, low and behold, the thing serves a very useful purpose! DUH!I'm a GTD newbie, but a lot of what Allen recommends just makes simple common sense, like his suggestion to contextualize our action items, that is, just make your lists based on where you are (at computer, at phone, at home, at office, etc), not on a perennially overly-optimistic list of things to do TODAY (that then have to be remade again TOMORROW because we seldom get half the things done on our list). Allen says that this self-demoralizing process is a dead end.But Allen's process of gaining a complete inventory has given me a fuller view of what I need to do and has helped me to process whole groups of tasks at a time.The book is long on process and relatively short on specific applications, but is well worth the mind effort that it takes to apply to your own challenges. In other words, the strength of Allen's GTD is demonstrated by the fact that it can work with paper- and computer-based processes. He assumes the lowest common denominator: paper-based, simply because everyone can relate to that. The problem for me was that I use a Palm Tungsten E2 synched to Microsoft Outlook. Thankfully plenty of quality third-party materials can be found on the web that use Allen's GTD.

"As a self-employed financial advisor and entrepreneur, I needed a better way to get my life in order.  That's right, not just my office, or my thoughts...MY LIFE!David Allen's Getting Things Done (GTD) single-handedly has done more for my productivity since I first read it 9 months ago than any other method I've attempted.  Sure, my former employer paid for a well-known company to train me in the ""organizational arts"", then I was sucked into the void known as ""the palm pilot"", next came ACT! software (which was okay for a while), before finally settling on Outlook.  Reading GTD, suddenly it became clear that the solution we all seek has nothing to do with the type of calendar you use, or what program you read your email with, but how to USE the tools you already have!Admittedly, I did run out over my lunch break one day an purchase a label maker and 200 manila folders.  It was at that moment, I experienced the breakthrough. Since putting Allen's ideas into action like the ""two-minute drill"", labeling EVERYTHING, and overcoming my fear of making a new folder for one piece of paper, I've have yet to misplace an important piece of paperwork and have re-located my sanity.Every person who I have recommended this book to says it completely changed their life.

"I found this book to be one of those rare works that significantly changed how I view the world, including how I work. Allen's unique contribution to the field of self-management is his practical bottom-up approach. His argument is that most of us are so overloaded, stressed, and distracted by the stuff (communications, commitments, and information) entering our lives, that we can't get our heads above water long enough to think about the big picture - am I doing the *right* job, am I living my values, etc.Another contribution is Allen's insights into how our minds work, esp. the idea that trying to use our brains as reminder systems (instead of idea-generating ones) has significant complications. This leads to his fundamentals, stated (ironically) at the end:* keep everything out of your head;* decide actions and outcomes when things first emerge on your radar, instead of later; and* regularly review and update the complete inventory of open loops of your life and work.The rest of the book shows how these principles are made real via his five workflow stages (collect, process, organize, review, and do). This is his third contribution: Most books on time management don't cover all aspects of how work flows into our lives, covering (for example), only the 'organize' portion.Finally, I say ""potentially life-changing"" in the title because getting on top of our ""stuff"" has a surprising payoff: Many people adopting Allen's methodology find their energy and creativity are dramatically freed up, leading to pondering (and progressing on/changing) those bigger-picture issues. In my case I quit my steady job and changed careers to become a workflow consultant.Highly recommended!","a great, potentially life-changing book","January 11, 2007",5.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFEAGONX6U57DF4JFES2VWF24FNA,matt

After 8 weeks of using GTD approach I am much more aware of what I am doing, see really important things, which were hidden under heap of urgent tasks and I have the feeling, that within few month I may get the picture of my life activities much more organized and clear.The style of the book is simple, no complex theory, just clear concepts, instructions and if needed, simple explanations, which gets you more motivated.Get the book.

"The self-help book industry runs rampant with cliches, euphemisms and gimmicks. Allen's book is a breath of fresh air in that it consolidates the most sound approaches in a way that speaks volumes to both the high-powered CEO and the graduate student just trying to get her dissertation organized!Allen's approach is centered around the idea that ""things that have your attention should have your INTENTION."" Although we know that is common sense, Allen offers a method of storing and processing the multitude of attention items, so that one can focus on one item at a time without worry about what's on the back-burner.In addition to offering concrete ideas for organization, Allen also addresses the emotional and psychological impediments to getting things done.  Unlike other authors, he does not patronize his readers or make them believe that they should aspire to be paragons of organizational virtue.

"I can't believe how much I ended up LOVING this book.  The top-down organization approach of other productivity methods never resonated with me ... GTD's bottom-up approach had me sucked in from the very beginning.I read the book about 6 months ago and I'm finding that adopting this methodology is an iterative process for me. I read the book, worked on some GTD concepts, then listened to the CDs, then fine-tuned my implementation some more. Now I think it's almost time to read the book again, to truly embrace things I may have dismissed as too difficult the first time.I've turned on a half dozen friends to this book...all people who believe in the philosophy of reducing physical clutter to improve the energy in their environment, so they were very receptive to the GTD ideas. I even met a new friend a few months ago, because I was reading the book while waiting for my car to be washed and she approached me about what a great book I was reading! We are now each other's GTD mini-support group!What's best for me is that these techniques don't require any special forms, books, and there's no guilt involved.

"Executives pay big bucks to learn the GTD process, the rest of us can get all the same results from this book - there is no excuse not to read it! David Allen has a unique approach to productivity: clear you mind, get things out of your head and into objective, reviewable formats. I never quite understood the metaphor 'mind like water' until I read this book. Now it makes sense - a tense mind is a slow mind. The book is full of extremely useful 'hacks' and tips you can add to your repertoire to boost your own productivity, and if need be, of your team.One thing I found extremely useful - prior to reading, listen to '43 Folders podcasts' (google it).

"I suffer from male pattern forgetfulness.  It amazes me the way that my wife can remember multiple events and responsibilities, and things slip my mind all of the time.  I recently finished reading this book, and I feel like perhaps now I can join the ranks of the truly productive.  My biggest problem before reading this book was letting things fall through the cracks (i.e., not calling people back, or taking clothes to the cleaners).  This system was designed for people like me, people who need to have a way to keep track of everything in a simple and straightforward way.The principles are simple:  Collect all the information that you can in designated ""inboxes"" (e.g., email, mailbox, voicemail), take time out to process that information and place it in the proper location (e.g., to-do list, reference file, calendar, do it right now), know exactly what your next action should be and do it whenever you can.  Allen also touches on how to make time for tackling your to-do list by evaluating your life-goals, your short-term goals, and your current responsibilities at home and work.  Hopefully, after doing some deep thinking about these things, you will be able to make time for what is more important, and therefore keep up with those things that you choose to prioritize.I enjoyed this book because it taught me a system that will allow me to be productive, keep track of my responsibilities, be in control, and truly relax knowing that there are not things running around in my brain that I need to do something about (it should be recorded somewhere, ready to be tackled as soon as I make time for it). I recommend this book to people who want to take control of their schedule, their responsibilities, and relax more wholly when they have down time.The only negative thing that I should mention is that I was a bit annoyed in the beginning of the book because I felt like it was a bit too ""self-helpish,"" mentioning zen-like concepts and a handful of ""If you are sick of...then get ready to...""-type statements.  Quit trying to persuade me to read the book, I'm already reading it.  Fortunately, these statements quickly gave way to many practical chapters that were nothing but helpful and informative.I borrowed this book from the local library, but I think I'll be buying a copy for future review.",This Should Be Required Reading for Any Student or Worker of Any Age,"December 9, 2006",5.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEUOOWSLSMO7DC55LDKB5UDMGSBA,Coconut Consignment

"David Allen is a knowledgeable and practical productivity guru. This book has both the strengths of practical and theoretical qualities. I loved this book. I liked about it that it explains a few theoretical principals related to the way the brain works, but not too many. It keeps the subject flow down to earth and it introduces the reader in a very simple, common sense manner to a set of real life tools.I found the book really helpful. I managed to setup my own system using two in-trays, Outlook and One-Note using David's principles of organisation. The book is free of superfluous motivational talk, it is based on research, personal experience built on many years of consulting organisations and individuals. I use the same routine flow at work and at home with no effort. I sometimes realise that when I get a mental trigger to simplify, process immediately something, it is because of the book. One of the key elements David insists on is that you must process the ""stuff"" immediately no matter what. You must decide what to do with it. The books somehow manages to store this idea in your mind using simple but powerful anchors.What does this book for you?Assuming we live at our fullest potential we were born with, success is conditioned by four factors: focus, goals (strategy), motivation and energy. David's book is about organising your life to give you clarity and focus. I liked how he talks about project organisation and how the immediate tasks are aligned to long term goals. The book is excellent about managing the first two factors. Motivation and energy:  that is your responsibility. If you need help there then you have to look somewhere else.How does the book help you do things better?One of the most common sources of frustration is hidden behind our little chores we have to do day by day. David has a take-no-prisoners approach: list everything you have in front of you and handle it, otherwise this procrastination will kill you. At this point, prioritisation makes no sense. To my surprise, this little principle does wonders. You have to have a system though, which is explained in the book very well. This is probably the best gem in the book: it gives you an workflow system that you can use without fail every day. David talks about how more complex tasks are actually projects, and he shows you how to manage that project naturally, using common sense. David then makes you look at this from the perspective of your personal life. He takes you on a nice flight from the ground level (daily little chores) to high altitude where you can view the distant horizons of your life. As usual, David alerts you that before you go up, make sure you do a good job on the ground. David says that the practice shows that this is the best way to discover your call and what is it really what you want. It makes sense: if you keep getting frustrated in seemingly never ending entangled tasks, you may never know what is it really that gives you pleasure and what is your natural talent.The main ideas of the bookWorkflow of the human activities: the humans are systems that have data input, process engine and output. Productivity is about managing all these three areas. David describes a very simple workflow that is made up of five steps:  1. Collect: get it out of your head 2. Process: decide what to do with it. 3. Organise: Decide where to put the stuff. 4. Review. Critical part of the workflow: weekly review. 5. DoThe whole system is built around this workflow. It sounds simple, and it is, but it is very effective. It is implementable and reduced the noise that unorganised ""stuff"" creates in our head. You will have to read the book to understand that.Decision Making ProcessThe system offers a fresh aproach to tasks organisation that is not based on common prioritised to-do lists system.  I found that David links very well the concern of the moment with long term planning and ultimately with your life calling. The latter is a very complex task. You have to muster the daily tasks management before you get the black belt on life long achievements, because this is the only practical way of discovering what you can do and what you are best at.Project planning.David considers project as a collection of tasks. While individual tasks can be done almost in any order, projects require planning. Instead of relying on learning very complex project management tools, it is best to manage your project using natural planning. If you have experience with project management you will understand straight away what he is talking about. If not, you will still like his approach because it is simple and requires common sense. It is all about delivering outcomes, rather than getting lost in complex considerations.Overall these are the key principles discussed in the book: 1. Focus and fast track 2. Applied outcome thinking (intention & action, how do I make it happen?) 3. The magic of mastering the mundane 4. The power of natural planningThe book has a very good structure. It is that kind of book you will come back to revisit some ideas. It requires a little bit of effort because, as David says, it will not work if you don't adopt it to suit your personal style and experience.

"While it may take two readings to really understand how to put this sytem to work, and to get your mind around the concepts, the pay-off is worth it. I have found that even though I have not completely cleared the decks and got everything into my inbox, even a partial implementation of the process, has within a few weeks, resulted in enormous benefits (and I'm pretty organized to begin with, or at least I thought I was). By 'partial,' I mean fully implementing the system for those pieces of information/to dos/projects/tasks that you have been able to gather and get under control. This also provides an incentive to deal with the rest of the 'stuff'. While the book may be a bit dry and repetitious at times, Allen is to to be commended for tackling a subject most of us would rather ignore. When you start using existing tools in different ways that yield new insights, you know that a shift has taken place. For example, Allen is right: the simple act of printing labels for your files seems to dignify them-you may find yourself getting carried away with creating labels and files for everything! The second counter-intuitive instruction was to ruthlessley clear the calendar of all 'to-dos' and put only the 'sacred' time/day specific items on it. I tried this with much trepidation and guess what? I'm getting far more done, and more efficently, by having less on my calendar! Lastly, for those who think this book is written only for CEOs, simply because those tend to be Allen's clients, don't. I'm not a CEO and I've primarily applied GTD to my personal affairs, rather than work,though there has been a great spill-over effect. It can work for anyone.

"A lot of what's in David's approach to organization is not earth-shatteringly different.

I've implemented his system now and have been running successfully with it for over two months and I can say that my effectiveness has increased dramatically.

"As somebody that has been labelled dis-organized by everyone I have lived with (from kinder to my actual boss and co-workers), I just learned not to view it as something deficent on my way of being, since that trait has not prevented me  living my true aspirations. So when I decided to purchase this book looking for some sort of guidance I was predisposed not to go into mindless observations of boring rules.First, as an audio book, it has been difficult for me to follow the free spririted essay format of the points Mr. Allen is saying, his language is erudite, his tone of voice serene and lectural, so for a road warrior (I listen to the cd books mainly in the car) and someone whose native language is not english, I found it very difficult to follow while driving. Do not misunderstand me, I had the certainty of receiving a good message, yet I after getting off the car I could not find a sense in direction in how to apply the techniques. So I decided to listen to the cd while sleeping playing them at the laptop in repeat mode. Well, it works, NOW I understand, yet I would still think a more structured format would be more effective.On the results on my self. The most difficult action for me was to place all my projects in paper in front of me. At first, I thought that I was just too important and complex to be reduce to a laundry list of projects. How embarrasing it is to just face a blank sheet of paper with some lines in it and having to say, is this it?!!  that made me realice something I have been doing all my life, I let all my projects be in my head, and as Mr. Allen points out, the head is not a good filling system, since ""unconcious ram"" never sleeps and does not have a way of distinguishing and sorting priorities of all the projects we are engaged in, so this ram causes stress (uneccesary stress that is). Letting it all out, without classifying schemes, priorities, urgencies or other schemes and then later, as a mind map, beging doing the natural connections and grouping. Yes, the projects were there, the connections of what to do and be on the look out become visible, and it reveals a far better map to actually plan your work load.I have taken some time to describe this experience in some detail to show you this is not a book just to listen to and let the thoughts sink-in, you have to work, and work hard, but providing you take this step you will have a new and valuable tool for your everyday use.","There is Method, there is thought and there is hard work","October 20, 2006",5.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHAXIDE63OTNUBX6PB4HD4ZBORWQ,Humberto Mejia
"I've been trying to organize my life for over 20 years, and have read innumerable books on the subject. While each one has offered something to add to the puzzle, none of them has told the whole story.I think this stems from the fact that no human being thinks or lives the same way, and no book can sufficiently cover the nuances of any single human life.That being said, this book is definitely one of the better ones. With its emphasis on bottom up management--putting the small things in order so that the bigger things fall into place, I think it is a more practical guide than the top down systems like Franklin Covey that insist you define every goal and purpose in your life before you make a list of things to do each day. This book offers a practical system for clearing your mind of all the undone things that torture it, and getting them in a place where they can be handled in a logical way. The system it offers for turning the ""stuff"" of life into organized bins of items is the best I've seen. The two-minute rule is another gem.There are flaws to the system, however. There is no clear way to prioritize one's activity list in Allen's system. The result of a long initial bout of organization is a long list of action items, sorted by where they can be accomplished (a useful principle), but with nothing suggesting which should be tackled first. I think a bit more salt of the long view in life would help in associating this list with the ultimate purposes in a person's life and help avoid the paralysis a long list of unsorted todos can produce.Still, I highly recommend this book. It's not the whole answer. But where it works, it works very well, and can be used as one of the main foundations in a personal system of organization.","Lots of good ideas, but not the whole story","October 19, 2006",4.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AG3A2JYKF5YDJSPU5YKQXBRTXOAQ,D.

"David Allen's _Getting Things Done_ continues to sell well. Obviously, people are stressed with all they have to do, so they look for any help they can get.They may not find it here.Books like Allen's always start with the same little conceit: ""My book advocates something new; it provides real solutions by not being just another _______."" For this book, fill in that blank with ""simple to-do list.""Great, you think, I've had enough of to-do lists. What you'll soon discover, though, is that Allen advocates a COMPLEX to-do list, incorporating a series of distinct FLOWCHARTS, of all things.Ugh. Robots are meant to operate off flowcharts, not people.The other conceit in this book plays into the American lifestyle of accumulation. Allen suggests the best way to keep track of all your stuff is to buy even MORE stuff to organize it all in. Buy more filing cabinets, more Post-It notes, more folders, more labelers, more, more, more!Our problems with organization are systemic. They need systemic answers. A person who is suffocating should expect a doctor to treat the airway issue, not call for some makeup to fix their blue skin color. Sadly, Allen applies foundation and blush to people who are drowning.We have too much stuff. Our lives are too hectic. That's all because the system we live in is broken. A smart man like Allen should be teaching business leaders how to make work easier for their employees rather than employees how to deal with the massive load of work their company leaders dump on them. He should be telling us how to drop out of buying more and more stuff that requires more and more of our time to manage rather than endorsing a consumptive lifestyle._Getting Things Done_ addresses only the symptoms.

"I believe that buying this book was the best investment I made this year (and a pretty small one too).If you are an over worked and stressed out workaholic as I am, with a To-Do list that can't be managed by any To-Do list Software tool available out there and having the feeling that things are about to grow above your head, causing sleepless nights because of the fear that you missed something important and how to get things done when they need to be done?If all some or all of that sounds familiar to you, this book is exactly for you. I have seen a bunch of books and tutorials about personal management, but none could solve my problems because of different reasons. The main one was most of the time the disability to apply the methods described to MY lifestyle and preferences.Well, this book is different, because it can be adapted to my life without me having to adapt to the book. It shows methods all known to me already organized and structure in a way that helps me to get my stuff organized and out of my head.Not only makes it my work more efficient, but also helps me to relax from time to time because I know what needs to be done and when.You can tell that the author knows his stuff very well. Any time a ""but... "" thought crossed my mind when he was explaining how to do something, a few lines or paragraphs later did he addressed exactly that leaving me without a ""but..."" question and feeling of doubt.

"I have read a number of books that deal with personal productivity and organization. This is the most intuitive approach yet. For instance, he suggests that instead of making a master ""to do"" list (intermingling all of the different tasks one needs or wants to accomplish) that you make different lists for different ""locales"". Make a seperate list of errands (so that when you are out and about, you just grab that list and go) or ""at computer"" (which is a list of things that you have to do on your...well...computer. Duh!) And so on for calls, office, home, etc.He also makes a great case for writing all the stuff you need to be responsible down, and advocates taking time to catch up on this practice at least every week. This is the key to being productive and remaining stress free. According to Allen, our brain will give us all the ideas we need for accomplishing the things we need to get done. However, if these ideas never get ""downloaded"", the brain feels responsible for holding on to them, and well not give you anymore ideas for getting things done. The fuller our brain gets, the more stress we feel because our intuition tells us there are things ""out there"" we are not dealing with. Anxiety sets in, and we walk around with knots in our bellies.There are many other great approaches to getting things done in this book. I adapted almost every suggestion the book offers. And, I get more done with less anxiety.

"I think that GTD is a really good system to get a hold on what you need to do in your workplace and your personal life and to boost your productivity.It hinges on a fairly simple system where you capture information in a number of ""inboxes"", including email, paper trays, notebooks, PDAs, whatever you have.From there you further categorise it into some straightforward categories and decide on your next actions.Very simple actions are subject to the two minute rule - that is if you have to do something and it will take two minutes or less, then do it now.I won't describe every nuance of the whole system, but the overall aim is to give you a ""mind like water"", basically a state of mind where you aren't feeling anxious, confused and stressed by what you need to do next, because you already have it noted down somewhere.Then, when you turn to your next actions, you don't even have to think as much about them, as you have, in theory, already decided what you need to do about them and just need to apply the energy to do them.So, yes, this is a good system that is seemingly flexible enough to deal with the regular chaos that pervades many people's workplaces and lives.You do, however, need to implement the system and stick to it, otherwise you undermine it. It has to become habit.I like this book as it is practical and self-contained, you don't really have to purchase extra volumes or add-ons to make the thing work, you just really need this book, a pen and a pad, and a little time to set the system up by refiling everything - buying a quantity of new stationery is also something that maybe required, depending on your level of dedication.What this book teaches is effectively a simple rounded administrative system that aims to reduce procrastination and delay, and increase productivity and efficiency, both in work and personal life.Thinking about it, administration although hardly the sexiest subject is a useful one, and one that can be really beneficial if it works.The problem with most workplaces and organisations is that their systems don't work, hence why things don't get done and fall through the cracks.This book offers a way forward that I have found very useful and easy to implement.The book itself, though, like the subject is very useful, but not the most pleasurable read. It is pretty good, and at least is devoid of any ""positive thinking"" philosophies, the closest you get is the ""mind like water"" phrase.However, rather than a pleasure read, this is more like learning a skill, and a very useful one at that.I do believe it can really boost an individual's or an organisation's productivity levels.Sadly, it does not hold a magic cure for making other people more efficient, unless you buy them this book and force them to read it.","Very good system, solid but not that entertaining book","June 23, 2006",4.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH2VNLZC2QUTU423UY6EGQGZNFVA,Sun Tzu

"David Allen presents an awesome organizational system in this book.  With just a little up-front effort, anyone really can become much more in control of his or her life.  I wouldn't say that GDT has changed my life, but I'm definitely less stressed now that I follow the system.The only problem is, Getting Things Done is terribly painful to read.  The problem stems mainly from the fact that there are about fifty pages in the book that contain real information.  The other two hundred pages are--no joke--almost word-for-word rehash of those fifty pages.  If I had a dime for every time Allen wrote, ""Your brain is like a computer.  If you fill up its RAM with the things you have to do, you don't get anything done,"" I seriously would have recouped my investment in this book.  I didn't appreciate that I had to search through the entire book to find just a few pages of original wisdom.If you're interested in this system--and, again, the system really is great--I recommend you check the book out at your local library.  If you later feel as though you need the book as a reference, you can always buy it.  And if you do read this book, don't feel bad if you skip most of the introduction and all of the last section (which read almost like a fifty page ad for David Allen's consulting services) and if you skim most of the rest.

"The premise is to de-clutter you mind, kind of like an information intervention, and you will be less stressed and more productive.  To do this, several techniques are offered: become an avid list maker, get all tasks, big and small, out of your mind and on to a trusted source.  A trusted source could be a notebook or PDA.  However, it must be someplace where you will not forget it! In other words, get tasks off you mind, out of your head, and onto something like a piece of paper.  These organizational techniques could be compared to the ""mind like water"" philosophy of karate.Other techniques involved clearly defining the problem and determining the very next action to move the task towards completion.  Managing your actions is the prime challenge involving time, information, and focus. For example, if tasks will take under two minutes attempt to do them immediately. Overall, there are several good techniques covered that many people already use, this method just wants those techniques to be used all the time and not just when things become overwhelming",Karate chop that clutter!!,"May 3, 2006",5.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFDWC23ZUQ6NTEPJHOUCRJDCLB6Q,IN058
"Too bad I didn't have this book years ago.  I ended up figuring out some of his best techniques in the book on my own just one year ago -- but before reading this book-- maybe that's why he calls them common sense-- you'd probably figure them out on your own eventually-- but the book will help many people figure it out sooner. After years of different systems, planners, notebooks, and finally the palm pilot.  I agree with Allen that the palm is too slow for input. Finally, I have everything I need to do on index cards in my wallet.  One for recurring tasks, one for priority tasks and one for projects. I have them organized by context as David recommends-- errands, computer, phone calls, and things I need to do at home with the next actionable steps.  The only card that needs frequent updating is the priority one. The only other lists I have is a grocery list and a phone list also on index cards (one card for each list.  I also keep a tiny month-to month calendar (the free hallmark ones) in my wallet. They are easy to refer to on the go and update them as needed.The only thing that I'm not quite sure I agree on from the book and some reviews is emphasis on bottom up rather than top down.  Perhaps this works better while on a job, but not for organizing personal things in my opinion. Having the top down priorities established helps establish and simplify the number of things that I decide to even attempt to embark on.  For example, as a stay-at-home mother of two children ages one and three pretty much simplifies my priorities for the time being. Deciding to go with only organic food simplified my grocery list. Deciding that a priority is educational and creative things for my son has changed my project list to include crafts and projects that we can do together etc.  I think a simultaneous top down, bottom up approach seems to work best for me.  The only reason some top down only approaches probably don't work is that they don't include the concept of the ""next actionable step"" and perhaps they encourage too lofty undoable goals that don't fit into your state in life and vocation.  The other problem with emphasis on top down is that as life changes, priorities change-- and these days that can happen quite often and unexpectedly. Marriage/divorce, moving, death/illness, birth, career change. Of the big five stressors two of them-- moving and job change can happen an average of every three years for the average person.  It always seems to me that as soon as I get myself organized a major life event happens to change everything again.Two things that I have found out help me keep stress out of my life are:Authenticity and Simplicity. You end up having less lists and less on your lists. I'd like to see an organizing book built around those ideas.",I wish I had this book years ago,"April 28, 2006",4.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AELCGBCD53ZMMFBGWQRWE3ZSCQJQ,Eve
"As a guy with a high-demand life and job, I have a hundred reasons to need a book with a title like this. But as a natural skeptic regarding techniques-especially one that promises `stress-free productivity'-I have a million reasons not to read it. You see, I think wisdom and courage have a lot more to do with stewarding the high demands and attractive opportunities that come our way than do `how tos' and `tips'.So I find myself pretty profoundly surprised by how powerful David Allen's system-he might prefer not to have it called that-has been in my life. The word that comes to mind for its result is `serenity'. Not quite `stress-free', that's a bit of a stretch and not true to life as I experience it.  But serenity over tension and productive order over chaos.Allen's goal is to free you up to experience a `mind like water' by managing all the things that rattle around in your brain on any give day into holding tanks where you're not wasting energy trying to remember them or regretting not having resolved them when you're trying to think about something else.  That mental liquidity is a martial arts term, Allen explains, that means `a condition of working, doing, and being in which the mind is clear and constructive things are happening.' Using common sense that's been refined by a lot of observation and a critical core of analysis, Allen's system gets you there.I find myself-as the author promises-much more likely to focus creatively on this task in front of me or to be present for this person who is locked in conversation with me.I rave.  I recognize it. I rave about this book.  I don't like people who rave overmuch or protest too loudly. But this book is worth every bit of fevered praise that has come its way.It's not about managing your time or finding more of it.  We each get the same 24 hours.

"To me, the greatest concept in the book is that of having a clear mind. On the first page of Chapter 1, he quotes David Kekich as saying, ""Anxiety is caused by a lack of control, organization, preparation, and action."" and then he proceeds to share his two major objectives for the book:-capturing all the things that need to get done into a logical and trusted system outside of your head and off your mind-disciplining yourself to make front-end decisions about all of the ""inputs"" you let into your life so that you will always have a plan for ""next actions"" that you can implement or renegotiate at any moment.This book offers a proven method for this kind of high-performance workflow management.I liked the book the first time I read it (4-5 years ago when it first came out), but I recently purchases the audio program he did, Getting Things Done Fast!, and hearing him speak about the topic brought such clarity that I had to read the book again.

"I was pretty organized and efficient before reading GTD--over the years I had learned a lot of the guidelines Allen pushes, such as the Two Minute Rule and the axiom that you always identify the Next Action in any project. As he says, most of this is just common sense.For me the big benefit of his system lies in the concept of emptying your head. It sounds trite, but it really works. As Allen states, in busy, chaotic modern life our minds must constantly work to remember all kinds of details and loose ends. We carry around so much of this mental noise we are no longer even conscious of it. Yet it is draining our energy and stressing us. After I had cleared all this ""stuff"" out of my head I immediately felt different. My wife even said I seemed more relaxed. And after several months the effect has persisted, because I have kept the discipline so far.And as Allen also predicts, I feel more creative. With the stress reduced, you just naturally have more ideas. Your mind feels clearer. It is kind of weird.WARNING: Another side effect is that you start thinking more about the big picture--where am I going, what am I doing--only now you find yourself really able to concentrate on these things. This can be uncomfortable if you were happy in the old rut. But Allen also predicts that this can happen. The book is based on his twenty years of coaching/consulting work.This last effect is a shock, considering that GTD is so bottom-up, take-care-of-the-details, in its approach. It is all a bit like the old Voltaire schtick: tend to your own garden and the world will take of itself. I was on guard for something more like Covey's Seven Habits with its top-down approach. I am not a Self-Help/Business-Guru Book groupie. I see by the Amazon reviews that many people read loads of these books and become real connoiseurs, so they can compare among them and I can't. Years ago, however, I heard so much fuss about Seven Habits that I broke down and read it. What a contrast to GTD: folksy, patronizing, preachy, and puritanical. If you are a good person you will be rewarded materially. As if scoundrels can't be efficient and successful. Allen's tone, on the other hand is grown up, practical, and business-like. A lot of his wisdom and seriousness comes through indirectly, and he alludes to higher things, but thankfully, consciously decides not to go there.Seven Habits brings to mind another point: I always disliked DayTimers and all that kind of thing. In the real world schedules don't survive. GTD promotes a loose, flexible system that matches what I have been doing for years: having my work and priorities mapped out but, as far as possible, not scheduled.Another laudable thing: refreshingly, Allen is not selling any software, stationary, calendars, schedulers, workbooks, or other collateral; GTD is a system or a method, but it's implementation is up to you. You can use paper, notebooks, folders, a PDA, a PC, whatever works for you. Essentially, as he often reminds, you are simply keeping lists, in order to get all the ""stuff"" out of your head.Implementing the system might require a couple of weekends, but you will not likely regret it.",the Judo of common sense,"April 7, 2006",5.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGQMCRFSNKU4SJ5DYFFCECOATVYQ,Salty

In it, Mr Allen offers extremely simple, flexible methods to get organized and increase productivity at work and at home.  And you don't need fancy equipment--I've been employing some of his ideas for 2 months now using a five dollar binder from Staples.  I've owned probably 10 day planners and one handheld, but never put them to proper use; most ended up quietly stashed in the corner of a drawer within a month or two.  Instead, Allen offers actual actions and methods; the specifics are up to you... he does offer techniques for the various ways of implementation:  loose-leaf binder, day planner, handheld PDA, etc.The Decently Organized:  Read this book.  The methods are helpful to fine tune your system... some are seemingly very simple, but are truly effective.The Hyper-Organized:  At least check this book out at a library and see if it works for you.  There are several good points about to-do lists and other lists, and the way they have of taking control.  Managing 20 to-do lists ends up being a 'to-do' item by itself.Bottom line:  This is a self-help organization book that is general enough to be adaptable to your life, but specfic enough to actually make a lasting impact.

It has already been very useful to me although I don't yet feel that I've implemented it to the extent to which it could help me. It could be described as a ""methodology"" as it consists of a discrete set of phases, but its real purpose is to explicitly demarcate the natural processes that our minds already use to organize information and plan our actions. Our natural tendency is to blur the line between these tasks, trying to do more than one at once, and getting frustrated because it's easy to lose track of what we're doing. It's billed as the ""next generation"" of time/life management (the previous generation being the Franklin/Covey school of thought) and I can see why.

"As the CEO of a small 9 person start up, I was handed this book by a friend.  I was highly skeptical and decided to give it a quick read on the train to and from work.Boy am I glad.David Allen spends the first part of the book giving you an explanation of why you're probably overwhelmed and then he outlines a vision of what life could be like when you're actually on top of the tons of emails, papers, calls and voice mails you're probably getting.Part II of the book is a 100% actionable, specific and flexible step-by-step process for building a personal workflow system.  It isn't hard to do - I got mine built in one day.Part III I didn't read to be honest - I didn't need to.  After finishing part II I was exactly where I needed to be - I am now getting about three times the amount of stuff done as I used to.  Nothing gets dropped, I'm a better leader and a better manager.  Plus I have better focus and concentration, so I think the quality of my productivity has raised substantially.If you're reading this review because you're wondering if this book might be worth the time, let me encourage you to get it.I'm buying a copy for every one of my employees, and I will be insisting that new hires start their careers with my firm by first reading this book and setting up their own personal workflow system based on the teachings of this book.

"Believe it or not, this is a key piece of advice offered by David Allen in Getting Things Done. He elaborates further, ""The labeler is a surprisingly critical tool in our work""...Other examples of action inducing wisdom that Allen has shared with ""...some of the world's most sophisticated and productive professionals"" include the following:* I keep a giant stack of fresh, new file folders instantly at hand and reachable from where I sit to process my in-basket. Nothing is worse than having something to file and not having an abundance of folders to grab from...* Always try to keep your file drawers less than three quarters full. If they're stuffed you'll unconsciously resist putting things in there...* The first activity is to search your physical environment for anything that doesn't belong where it is, the way it is, permanently, and put it into your in-basket.* What kinds of things do you need with you all the time? Those must go into your ubiquitous planner.* What do you need specifically for meetings or off-site events? That should be put into your briefcase, pack, satchel, or purse.Is this guy for real? The author himself admits, ""People often grimace when I tell them that my wife, Kathryn, and I put things in each other's in-baskets, even when we're sitting within a few feet of each other; to them it seems `cold and mechanical'"".As a chronically disorganized person I can't resist the temptation to lampoon statements such as these. However, actually this is a deep and substantive book, and its significance follows out of its deceptive simplicity.Allen's essential thesis is that most people expend tremendous energy trying to keep track of things in their head. Invariably, at any point in time many items are unfulfilled commitments, and their existence in the mind, even on an unconscious level, creates energy sapping dissonance.The elaborate system of neatly labeled files is nothing more than a reliable receptacle to facilitate the offloading of all of this material, in effect clearing the mind. Allen advocates deconstructing projects to the next actionable steps, and then knocking them off one by one. This is a bottom up approach, very different from that of most time management systems that drill down from the big picture to establish priorities. While this is quite counterintuitive, the author makes a convincing case, and as I read it I was overcome by a groundswell of enthusiasm.There is a confession that I need to make that underscores my five star recommendation of Getting Things Done. I just went out and bought not one, but two labelers - one for the office and one for home. I find that I can't imagine being without one near at hand.

"I'm not being critical of this book, it just wasn't for me. It stressed me out to read it.I agree with the editorial review that although Allen uses terms borrowed from eastern philosphy ""it still operates from the decidedly Western notion that if we could just get really, really organized, we could turn ourselves into 24/7 productivity machines.""To me this was a trendy book.His book stresses the notion that modern times with email and pda's are so different and more complex than in the past. I usually distrust the ""not your father's""  mentality. New technological or gadget innovations do not cause huge mental shifts. Also being a web developer/techie, I am put off by the ""download"" and other computer terms to describe mental or organizing processes. The only people who do this are these trendy guru types.Also, this book is about an organization system, so if that is what you need, you found the right book. The idea of the ""big picture"" is very lightly touched upon in this book.  I prefer systems that flow from what brings me happiness, joy, meaning and fufillment. With this book, the organization system: folders, files, papers, heirarchies is much more important.For an emphasis on the ""big picture"" read Allen Laiken's book: How to Get Control of Your time and Your Life.

"This book is about action, about preparing to act, and about turning the choice of how to act into something self-apparent, everywhere and every day.The premise is realistic: you have lots of unrelated things to get done. They all move forward, a step at a time, interleaved throughout the day,week, and year,  and not always under your control. It seems overwhelming, as if you'll never remember it all. You're half right - you won't and can't remember it all, but it doesn't havetobe overwhelming. The good news is that you don't have to remember it, as long as you're reminded when and where you need to be. That means when and where action is possible.That's what this book is about, turning inputs and goals into actions that step towards the goals. What you can do, do. What you can't, write down. The pervasive message is that everything is either a reason to act or is in the way. Allen's system supports that belief by creating simple systems to make it work. He's not selling any products here, just a few files, folders, and other simple items are all it takes.After laying out his eminently sensible system, Allen goes on to make some rather grandiose claims about personal transformation. I'm not sure I buy all that, but I don't have to. If I try his techniques and they happen, then great. If I try them and just make better use of my time and attention, than that's great too.//wiredweird","Should be ""Get Things Done""","February 5, 2006",HALL OF FAME,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF7EPZEJCL3KKSMZVCBYPGGTPISQ,wiredweird

"I wrote this review in Nov '05 on my blog.So I wrapped up Getting Things Done by David Allen yesterday. All i have to say is that I know life is not going to be the same for me again. Ok so its a rather drastic statement to make after reading a Personal Organization System book but its just something you have to read to believe.As per the editorial review, GTD offers a complete system for downloading all those free-floating gotta-do's clogging your brain into a sophisticated framework of files and action lists--enabling you to free your mind to focus on whatever you're working on.The man is a genius at this stuff, you'll know what i mean soon as you get done reading chapter 1. I'm not going to do a chapter by chapter review and conclude the way thousands of other reviewers alredy have, no point wasting my time, instead I'm going to challenge anyone who reads this book and finds it a total waste of time. I'll buy back the GTD copy from the person and give that money to their favorite charity. Ok i'll throw in a couple extra bucks in the pot, make some bum really happy.So you should read this book if you:* Forgot your spouse's birthday/anniversary for the 2nd time this last three years. The odds are not going to get better.* Realize you are still work in progress and dont want to be in the same condition you are in this time next year a.k.a self help junkie.* Want to organize your career/projects/life cause it gets overwhelming at times, awwhh come here, *hugz.** Haven't had anything scratched off your to-do list for some time now, or better yet have no idea what a to-do list is.So should i wait a couple of months before i purchase this book, maybe it'll end up in the 50% off bin, besides I'm still reading the Da Vinci Code?Not gonna happen, anyway its out on paperback and you really shouldnt waste any more time, Slacker!!

"This is a classic in the field of personal productivity, and I need to periodically re-read it to adjust my processes...  Getting Things Done - The Art of Stress-Free Productivity by David Allen.Allen has created a system that is miles ahead of the typical calendar and to-do list techniques.  He examines how the mind works when it's spending time trying to track things in the mental ""in-basket"", and how that creates a mental drain that saps any attempt at being productive.  The system doesn't rely on going out and buying some branded material that serves mainly to pad the bank account of the author.  In fact, the GTD methodology can be practiced with as little or as much technology as you feel comfortable with.  When I first started to use the GTD techniques, I used a leather portfolio, paper tablet, and post-it notes to move around.  Worked great, and I don't know why I allowed myself to drift away from it.  My wife even asked me why I wasn't getting as much done as I used to...  :)Allen's writing is clear and easy to read, with emphasis on practicality and experience.  It's nearly impossible to not come away with an understanding of the system and the underlying reasons for why it would work.  If I had to point out any flaws, it's that the flexibility of the system can make it a bit difficult to understand how you might want to personally apply it.  It might be nice to have some examples of how people have applied the principles, along with the mechanics of how they make it work.This is one of those books that can change your life...  highly recommended.",A classic in the field of personal productivity...,"December 11, 2005",5.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFO2V4BB6XKSPYPYJ37PVJSKCBNA,Sharing Thoughts

"""Getting Things Done"" is an excellent book on getting organized so that you can dedicate your time to working on your work, rather than just thinking about it.  Author David Allen goes through a workflow that is design to help you take control of your life and tasks.The logic behind David Allen's workflow is sound.  Essentially, all tasks are placed in an inbox where they are then categorized and organized.  This then frees up your thinking to work on the task rather than think about it.I would have liked to have seen more visual diagrams however.  Many times I had to think back to exactly where in the workflow he was talking about.

"This book takes an entirely different tack from most other getting-organized books.  Other authors advocate figuring out the big picture first ... but most of us are so busy with daily fires that the luxury of high-level goals seems beyond our grasp.  With his bottom-up approach, David Allen starts you off you a few simple  ways to get a handle on your everyday tasks -- so that you can free up enough mental space to even start to think about your long-term goals.  Once your head is clear and you're no longer burning so much energy on tracking things that are better tracked externally, other books (like Stephen Covey's <u>Seven Habits of Highly Effective People</u>) make nice companions to Allen's work.The tips and tricks that Allen presents here are largely common sense (by his own admission), but his presentation is so lucid -- and yet, at the same time, inspiring -- that these ""common-sense"" approaches finally clicked for me.  I had 2400 emails in my work inbox before I read <u>Getting Things Done</u>.  A month later, I go home every night with my work inbox empty and with more actually accomplished -- and I come in each day with a clear picture of what work remains ... and a firm belief that I won't drop the new balls that get tossed my way.These techniques and their underlying principles aren't a magic bullet; I still have to work daily on improving my processes and habits.  But after you see your work through the lens that Allen gives you, you'll be better able to use the methods that you're already using more effectively -- and with a clearer picture of why they work, you can make them work better.Quitting the selective-processing habit ""cold turkey"" and tracking all of your outstanding ""open loops"", large and small, isn't easy.  But if you even do a couple of the things that Allen describes, you'll immediately start to see the benefits -- and be hungry for more.",Most effective getting-organized book I've ever read,"September 11, 2005",5.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHZGAGUJ7S3LPE27BMBOAZ4XDNKA,Royce Williams
"GETTING THINGS DONE is the book everyone's talking about. If you haven't read it, you need to get a copy. I didn't buy this book for myself; it was a gift from someone who knows I get overwhelmed at times trying to manage a home business as well as a busy household. (What to do about thousands of emails! What to do about 80 million exciting projects I want to get involved with! What to do about getting kids' school papers organized! What to do about supper!)I've read tons of books on getting organized, but I can say this one is the grand finale. Here's what I used to do: make a daily to-do list that I think about all day. Worry about the things I didn't get around to doing. Talk about how worried I am about the things I need to do. Then go to bed discouraged, transferring my to-do list to another day.Forget this system. It doesn't work, and it makes you one stressed-out person. Especially if you're a mom, and you can't accomplish all the things you know you COULD accomplish if it were just you. You've got a house full of people and pets and projects and plans that interrupt your goal-setting and list-making.David Allen's system is a beautiful thing. Don't throw away your leather calendar, your Blackberry, or PDA -- whatever it is that you use -- keep it. Just use your calendar to record those events that must be etched in stone: work deadlines, doctor appointments, birthday parties, soccer games, the day you're supposed to bring a meal to someone, etc. You'll need your calendar for those things. But DON""T use it to make a to-do list.First of all, you've got to process all of your STUFF and start thinking in terms of in-box. Allen says the reason why people are stressed out is because there are so many ""open loops"" in their lives -- things they mull over that aren't complete. Instead, you need to think in terms of ""What's the next action?"" Make a list of your projects, and put it into a folder, labeled ""Project list."" This includes anything that is an open loop that you need to get done.Next, take a single sheet of paper for each open loop and write ""Next action"" at the top. So, instead of writing, ""Tires"" on your list when your car needs new tires, you'll write the steps you need to do. 1) Call Fred who knows the good place to get new tires. 2) Call tire place and check out prices 3) Make appt. 4) Drop car off to get new tires. Using this method allows you to completely free your mind because it's all written down, allowing you to have a ""mind like water.""What works well about this Next-Action technique is that you can make productive use of minutes here and there throughout the day when your energy or concentration may not be at their maximum. If you're stuck in the carpool line, make a few calls on your cell phone (but DON'T waste time talking on your cell phone when your kids are in the car! Talk to your kids! That's my personal pet peeve when I see parents ignoring their kids to talk on their cell phone...)Allen says, ""This is one of the best reasons for having very clean edges to your personal management system; it makes it easy to continue doing productive activity when you're not in top form.""What's the end result? The author says, ""When people with whom you interact notice that without fail you receive, process, and organize in an airtight manner the exchanges and agreements they have with you, they begin to trust you in a unique way...It noticeably enhances your mental well-being and improves the power of your communications and relationships, both personally and professionally.""The ultimate goal of this incredible system is that your mind is freed up to do what you REALLY love to do, and that is THINK. Don't most of us wish we could just FOCUS when we want to without our minds jumping around to the meat we've got to thaw, the vet appointment we need to make, the errand we forgot to run, etc.? YES!Well, I've oversimplified things to write this review. Just get the book and read it. Allen also has an active website where you can find a helpful community of people all implementing this system. What I liked most about the book is that Allen says it's the brightest, most imaginative people who really struggle -- because we think of all the possible outcomes and we freeze our agendas. Using his techniques to ""do it, defer it, delegate it, or drop it,"" we can forge ahead.Enough said.

"Very good book.  Has many good ideas as most others have stated.  However, I found it falls apart in giving definitive concepts for executing projects.  He touches project execution only superficially and any related details are not well thought out.  Thus, you are left with confusion in how to handle projects.I find this especially disappointing when he defines a project as any thing we need to get done that is comprised of more than a single action step.  Wouldn't that be most of our work worlds?  I believe so.  Especially, if you have managerial responsibilities.On pages 54 and 55, he explains that ""most of the time"" you only need the single step (horizontal) method.  He states ""Sometimes, however, you may need greater rigor and focus to get a project under control"" and ""every once in a while you may need to develop a more formal structure or plan...""  Those appear to be the reasons he doesn't include a way to integrate projects, with their various sequences and scopes, into his system.  To state that you MAY need to manage a project or that ONCE IN A WHILE you will need a way to plan and manage them, is to ignore reality for most people, again, especially those in management.In summary, it's still a very practical and useful book.

"""Getting Things Done"" is an incredibly helpful book.  It's been indispensable for my personal productivity.  It teaches you to do a few things well and does so in a relatively clear manner.However, it has two serious problems.  First, it is presented as a complete organizational system, when it is not.  Second, it encourages a seat-of-the-pants, ju-jitsu approach to daily life that can be very counterproductive and exhausting.But, first the good.  For me, the main gist of the book is this: if you try to keep your life organized in your head, you will not be maximally productive.  You'll be using an inordinate amount of energy trying to mentally keep track of all your ""to do"" items.  ""Getting Things Done"" shows you how to get all of these out of your head and into a system so you can concentrate on the present and attack each action item one at a time.  This is good stuff.But, now, the bad (or not so good):The first problem is ""Getting Things Done"" provides no guidance on how to prioritize your projects or sub-projects.  It does not help you decide what to do next.  Instead, it helps you produce very organized, contextual lists of next actions to take.  To decide WHICH next action to take, it just recommends that you use your instincts.  For many people, one of the big problems (and often THE big problem) with their organization is DECIDING which projects to work on when; and GTD is of absolutely no help.  This is not an insurmountable problem as there are books (""Time Power"" by Charles Hobbs) and computer programs (Life Balance from Llamagraphics), that can help you prioritize.The second problem, and perhaps considerably more grave, is ""Getting Things Done"" encourages you not to plan.  It encourages you to simply decide in each moment what to do (based on the excellent lists and reminder system you've created).  It encourages a seat-of-the-pants, ju-jitsu approach to daily life.  And this is a BIG problem for a lot of people, myself included.  If you have trouble prioritizing what to do next in your day and life, then having to make those prioritizing decisions 200 times a day, as GTD encourages, is incredibly draining.  GTD preaches that you live life efficiently, but that there's no need for habits or rituals.  This is a contradiction and truly counter-productive.If there's one common thread that you get from reading the biographies of incredibly productive and successful people, it's this: they have very regular, structured, and beneficial habits and rituals.  They do not ""wing it.""  ""Getting Things Done"" could be retitled ""Winging It In the Most Efficient Manner Possible.""  There are successful people, of course, who do ""wing it,"" but the vast majority of successful people are habit- and ritual- driven.  That goes especially for work habits (and often for sleep habits, exercise habits, eating habits, and social habits, too).  For a great example of this, read ""On Writing,"" by Stephen King.If you read ""Getting Things Done,"" seriously consider supplementing it with ""The Power of Full Engagement,"" by Jim Loehr and Tony Schwartz -- especially chapter 10, ""The Power of Positive Rituals.""  It explains very convincingly why purposefully ""winging it,"" even in the most efficient manner, will not work and could be your undoing.""Getting Things Done"" is still a great book, but it does not stand well, on its own, as a system for organizing your life.

"What I got out of this book, I got from the first three chapters.  The rest was unnecessary repetition and excrutiating detail of each step outlined in the first few chapters.  I agree with the reviewer who said this could have been a much shorter book.Also, maybe I'm just not the organizing type, but if I had all my lists with me so I could use every spare moment to do my next action items, I'd want someone to shoot me.  Sure, I usually drag a book or magazine along somewhere in case I'm stuck waiting, but just as often I'll daydream, watch people, or smell the roses (sometimes literally).  In a way, I believe this down time makes me a more productive person than someone who's always riding herd on his PDA (see Carl Honore's book In Praise of Slowness).Of course, I'm also not exactly an executive, nor do I aspire to be.  Unless they have executive positions in smelling roses.So maybe if you're an executive, you'll find all this ueber-organization helpful to you, but to me, it was just a bore.","Quite a bore, actually","May 23, 2005",2.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFMMY3EJTWRWO22ZBGFYIUYMK34A,Debbie the Book Devourer

"Covey's top-down approach just won't work for the most of us because it is totally backwards.

"This is one of the best books I have ever read on being organized. Ever since I read and actually did what is in this book it ""seems like"" I have a lot more free time.You must find a free weekend to really make it work. Part of the whole process begins with a weekend that the author walks you through doing. I have been to literally hundreds of seminars and this weekend was worth more than almost all of the seminars I had ever been to.There are some additions that I add to his book to make it even better.The first is breaking down what is scheduled to 3 categories. Scheduled or doing now. Not doing now. And Never Doing now. It is being honest with yourself and what you are doing. This helps free the mind because now the non-conscious and conscious are in agreement. All your projects would be in the ""not doing now"" category until you actually schedule the tasks from with in the products into ""doing now"".The next is keeping in mind.

"In December of 2004, I joined a cult. No, it did not involve dressing in orange or waiting for Armageddon, and as far as I know a collective suicide is not yet planned. Yet, the degree in which a new modus operandi pervaded every aspect of my life, as apparently pervades the lives of others, was simply astonishing.Simply put, the New Year resolutions were approaching, and I decided that in 2005 I would get things done. The goal: reduce the overwhelming and reportedly life-shortening stress that rules my life.  Like you, I had tried them all:  twelve-step groups, yoga every Friday and even meditation, workday mornings; then positive affirmations, biofeedback and Metamucil.  I even tried weaning myself off that quarter to half a gallon of afternoon coffee, which kept me buzzing until midnight with quite unpractical management ideas, and running precipitously to the bathroom down the hall while thinking about the next snappy email retort.I had looked at other methods.  The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen R. Covey just did not take, I think mostly because, unlike the author, I'm really lazy, petty, and morose. And that's my good side. Rather, I needed something that could really exploit the one thing I can do: plan.  I can plan endlessly, I could have outplanned Rommel. I constantly fill out lists of tasks from the trivial to the surreally complicated, from checklists of what 5 dry cheeses to bring camping to complex plans for taking over pizza delivery franchising in small third world nations.  I found my answer in Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity, by David Allen, CEO coach, guru and resident of nearby Ojai, a small city that I had associated with good hiking and mediocre tourist restaurants rather than management bliss.The principles of ""Getting Things Done"" are simple and intuitive: keeping too much in mind is source of stress.  Therefore, one must periodically download the entire mind content in some support, any support. Paper works as well sophisticated electronic gadgets.  Then, break down each life plan or business transaction into projects, and again break out each project into actions, and decide what the next action is going to be.  Once a week or so, review what you are doing and make sure you still cam see the forest for the trees.  This works using basic skills we are all bound to have, if we have any competence at all to carry out our daily business, personal or work-related.The GTD phenomenon has generated at least three high traffic mailing lists ([...] [...] [...]) and countless websites dedicated to applications of Allen's philosophy to the most diverse environment, from effective filing in law offices to achieving the mastery of the grocery list.As it often happens, the mailing lists serve as gathering and hangout of at list four kinds of genially flawed characters:The hacker: the GTD hacker is usually a male geek, pushing the boundaries of technology to achieve the perfect efficiency in implementing efficiency.  He is the master of the latest software applications, and mysterious codes seem to track every aspect of his life.  Even his underwear has embroidered secret wiki codes that almost inexplicably speed up the laundry chores. Aside from the mentioned embroidery work It's easy to recognize hackers by the ""manbag"" or ""murse"", an essential tool that besides putting the GTD hacker in touch with his feminine side, allows space and multiple pouches for all the gadget, devices, and batteries dedicated to Get Things Done.The hipster: the hipster can do (or claims he can do) on paper everything we do on our electronic gadgets.  They shuffle pieces of paper and rubber bands, invest in prestigious brand notebooks; claim the supremacy of long hand versus keyboards. It's easy to recognize GTD hipsters by the fountain pen spots on their shirt and the packs of index cards bulging in their pockets.  Did you just have weekly review or are you happy to see me?The mystic: the mystic is looking beyond managing task, rather seeking enlightenment and revelation.  They spend time discussing and analyzing the Word of David, looking for purity of meaning beyond any individual practical application. The GTD mystic will have all categories of tasks starting with ""@"", like ""@work"" or ""@tack!""The depressed: often a terminal procrastinator, the GTDepressed are looking for the meaning of life in structure rather than content, seeking group solidarity and a way to finish the manuscript of their 80s dissertation. Some GTD depressed become incredibly accomplished celebrity stalkers.The way of the GTD samurai is not without its side effects. GTD is a hungry dog, a mutant virus, a mother in law continuously looking for something worn to wash and iron, a structure looking for loose ends to organize.  It can follow you in the most intimate and non business-related parts of your life, including relationship, recreation and of course sex.  Weekly reviews, where the GTD adept evaluates the meaning of life and work in context are often painful experiences, in which the results of the brain dump of the previous seven days have to be fit back into the big picture, all the life goals, the noble intentions.

If Man is not the sum of what he has already, but rather the sum of what he does not yet have, of what he could have, can weekly reviews extend well into the weekend?Then there are those relationship-related side effects: my wife is getting unnerved, her womenfriends commenting on my personal case study of digital folly.

In fact, not only I have mastered the art of the Google mail filter, but I also offered to synch our Palm Pilots together.But perhaps the biggest drawback is the sudden disappearance of empty time, as every space between non-contiguous events in the agenda gets filled with very efficient entertainment processes.  Serendipity vanishes as well, with boredom on the verge of extinction, being limited to those cases of system malfunction when you are not sure of what one should decide the ""next action"" should be.But again, like Jean Paul said, it is only in our decisions that we are important.

"Getting Things Done provides a great concrete framework for how to manage your pending work in an external, easy to access, and easy to keep up to date form. I've personally adopted it and love both the freedom that it gives me and the flexibility that it has in what can be on paper, electronic, or a pile of stuff. I look at it more as some techniques than specific practies.The caution I have about this book -- which I actually would recommend, despite the 3 star rating -- is that the techniques without a framework might not be quite enough. For instance, if you're a Seven Habits fan, you'll also get some guidance around prioritizing work, saying ""no"" to things, and ensuring long-term success. GTD is more focused on managing work you think is on your plate and handling whatever comes up, whether you really should or not. I've also found that I need to manage my long-term ""nice to have"" projects incrementally and don't really buy Allen's statement that you would be surprised how much progress you make on them just by writing them down. Finally, though I agree that putting a big list of tasks onto a day to get them done can be demoralizing, I do like to do things like block out hours of my calendar to work on tasks.So, a good book, a worthy read, but I'd advise that you also read some of the other literature in this area to make sure that you're not just learning to spin your wheels faster.

"David Allen is considered to be one the top five Management consultants in North America according to a Forbes article. I now understand why.The basic concepts in his book are simple enough and are represented by a flow chart, but there are so many other golden nuggets of ""best practice"" information within this book that you have to study it to get them all.  I've read the book and listened to his second (audio) book ""Ready for anything"" four times in a row just to reinforce the great points within this book.The result of implimenting his structure of workflow has suprisingly allowed me to act with more freedom and creativity in my job and a reduction in stress. I can even find stuff easily since setting up my folders and buying a label making machine (his recommendation).He's really on to something big with his ""next action"" thinking approach (chapter 11) and his two-minute rule.One of the best books I've read in the last three years.",It changed my life,"February 27, 2005",5.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHRT4X3T5EQNTCKA2TLO6LX7AWUA,D.

"Fifty years ago, having a simple to-do-list would put you at the top of the productivity charts.  Thirty years ago, paying attention to time management would do the same.  Today, looking at workflow gives us the next step in the evolution of effectiveness.The book, Getting Things Done, is divided into three parts.  The first is called ""The Art of Getting Things Done.""  This is where the author, David Allen, lays out the basics of mastering workflow and getting projects creatively underway.The key to getting control of your life is mastering that workflow.  Once stuff shows up in your ""inbox,"" what do you do with it?  Allen gives you a straightforward way to process what's in your ""inbox"" without getting bogged down.His key insight is to concentrate on the next necessary action for any project you might be working on.  That's especially powerful.  Procrastination often comes from not knowing what the next action to take should be.  Using the action list that Allen recommends, you should cut down your procrastination significantly.I should note here that action in Allen's sense doesn't mean ""deciding"" or any other such activity, unless it results in something visible.  That keeps us out of the action list that are filled with things where you start to prepare to begin to get ready to do things, and moves you right on to the doing itself.Allen covers this material in twenty-five pages, and it is the core and key value of this book.  If you buy the book for the workflow system and the insights that Allen has into it, you'll get more than your money's worth.Alas, on page fifty-four in my edition, Allen starts talking about getting projects creatively underway.  I found this material to be pretty garden-variety stuff.  No big insights.  In fact, it suffers from what lots of other material on planning suffers from, the idea that planning is a straight-through process without an iterative looping around as you would adjust goals and plans.Once the early material on project management wraps up Part One, you could move on to Part Two.  Part Two is about Practicing Stress-free Productivity.  Actually, it's not about that at all.  What it is about, in one hundred plus pages, is how to get this entire system started.  We get recommendations down to the file folder level.  This may be helpful to you.  I found it useless padding in the book.At the end of this section, he loops back to the workflow diagram that he'd covered a hundred pages earlier.Part Three takes us back to the Power of Key Principles, and it's worth reading as a review, as well for several specific tips that are embedded in it.Now, it may seem from my comments just above, that I don't think this book is worth the money.  That would be inaccurate.  This is simply one of the best, and most helpful books, I've ever read on organizing.  For me, the value was in the workflow process and the things around it.  I didn't need the stuff on Getting Started, and I didn't like the stuff on Project Planning.We each come to books like this with different backgrounds and needs, and so if your needs are different than mine, you may find other pieces of this book valuable.  One thing I'm sure of - if you buy the book, you'll find value in it.","Excellent Insights, Lots of Padding","February 26, 2005",4.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHNNT47XPXOXDZDKMST7IES554HQ,Wally Bock
"Author David Allen states the obvious...we will all be more productive if we are more organized, both in our work and our lives outside of work.  Ok, that's not exactly earth-shaking news.  It's the actualy getting organized part that leaves most people stumped.Allen is focused on in-boxes, both literally and figuretively.  Our in boxes being not only the things on our desks, but applying to anything task we need to do in our lives no matter how mundane.  Allen has what he refers to as the ""Two Minute Rule"" wherein if there's anything you absolutely must do that you can do right now in two minutes or less, then do it now, thus freeing up your time and mind tenfold over the long term.  That makes perfect sense.  And that is what this book is in broadest terms:  common sense.  These are things you probably know but just may no know the best way to organize them.The book is very ""system oriented"" with all sorts of clever phrase-ology.

Mr. Allen presents a fairly convincing argument that the best thing you can do is to scrap your ""to-do"" lists and adopt a system that allows you to process information on a ongoing systematic basis.  He believes that most people bog down in their efforts to reduce their burdens because they are relying too much on their memories and not enough on a system that allows them to retrieve and process information.  I've only started to put his suggestions into practice but already believe that I've become more efficient in processing the vast amount of paperwork that comes across my desk on a daily basis.

"I've been trying for years to ""get organized"".  I've tried elaborate to do list scenarios on my Palm organizer; I even had a consultant in many years ago as part of my professional development to help me work through and prioritize endless stacks of e-mail and things to do.  Before the company spam filter was put in place, it was almost all I could do to get through my spam and delete it every day.One of the problems is that I don't really like being organized.  I naturally prefer to work through issues as they arise and follow new leads that look promising.  While this approach works fairly well given my job (I research new technologies) it can be a problem when things pile up as I'm off exploring new venues.Recently I ran into this book by David Allen.  It has by far the most comprehensive and common-sense system for managing day-to-day tasks that I've seen.  His basic premise is that the brain is a lousy place to try and keep track of all the things you have to do.  After all, we can only keep seven or eight things in short-term memory.  Add to that the fact that the brain will constantly remind us of those things we need to do in situations when we can do nothing about them, and you have a recipe for stress.Allen's suggestion is to track everything we need to do in a simple system, whether it be paper-based or electronic.  The key to a stress free mind is to make sure that everything that needs doing is tracked in the system.  You accomplish this through a simple process of reviewing items as they come into your various inboxes (e-mail, paper mail, phone mail, hallway conversations, etc) and deciding what to do with them.  If a task takes less than two minutes to accomplish, do it immediately.  If you can delegate it, do so. If the item is reference material, file it.  Otherwise, make an entry for it in your system, being careful to identify next actions for each item.  Then you can be confident that everything you need to do is in your system leaving your mind stress free and enabling you to quickly find what needs doing next.There's more to it which I won't belabor here, but it's basically a simple system.  The book contains many examples and refinements that make it well worth reading.  Allen also teaches day long management seminar courses.As for technology, Allen uses the Palm to-do list.  I've been using software called Life Balance which also has a desktop and a Palm interface.",Best approach I've seen to task/life management,"October 27, 2004",5.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHIBZRXFHR3IRX5ZUBAV7BVNW5BA,Bill Wood
"If you are a 'knowledge worker', i.e. working in a job where your actions are not always, if ever, pre-defined for you, then you will find this book extremely useful.

Like most of the great behaviors in life, it is not complicated and is rooted in common sense. Once I began to employ some of the techniques outlined in this book, I did notice an improvement in productivity or at the very least, a reduction in time wasted on non-productive activities.It is worth highlighting that implementing this system effectively, which must include the concept of the regular review, is not easy and is something that can't be done without disturbance to old habits. In fact, it can be quite challenging and requires some real self-discipline. However, like many things, you will get out of this what you put in.This particular book is at the heart of the David Allen GTD system and additional material is available through his seminars etc. In reality, this book is probably all you will need to get up and running with this system.

"Before I read it, I took this as an ordinary time management book (see the clock-shaped ""O"" in the word DONE in the front cover) about prioritization, planning, procrastination, delegation with some tactics on phone calls, how to say no and so on, inexplicity targeting those with middle to upper management positions. However, I still picked it up for its enchanting tagline ""how to achieve stress-free productivity"". To my surprise, this book's quality is well beyond my expectation. Beside the usual stuff described above, there are plenty of productive tidbits on, say, filing, drawers, checklists, clips, paper notes etc etc., with Zen style messages and idioms furnishing those very practical and easy to use models for choosing actions in the moment, evaluating daily work and so on. The insertion of small dialogue boxes beside keypoint paragraphs certainly helps readers much to grasp important ideas.

So often, we get caught up in our day-to-day tasks, we forget to step back and view the big picture. Yet one of the habits I've noticed in very successful people is that of consistently keeping the big picture in mind.

"David Allen is a genius!  A few months ago, I was looking for a way to get organized and motivated about ""getting things done"" on a more timely basis.  I am so glad that I ran into this book at the book store!Mr. Allen puts forth a very simple, down-to-earth approach to accomplishing more in less time and with less stress.  I am absolutely hooked on his approach to organization and daily productivity.  I read this book through twice because it was so helpful and full of great advice that I wanted to make sure I adapted and changed my thinking fully.The basic plan is to get everything out of your mind and into your organizational system where it belongs.  Once you have your system set up with the proper ""buckets"" to hold all the items you need to deal with (and some that you don't need to deal with,...yet), you can clear your mind of the stress and worry that goes along with thinking about them subconsciously every waking moment.Throughout your day, you knock out any actionable items and place the unfinished ones in the appropriate ""bucket"", depending on their status and the context of how they will need to be processed later.  Once these items are in place, you can forget about them until the next moment you have time to process more items.The weekly review is a major part of this entire system.  Mr. Allen covers each step with great detail and provides outstanding tips and advice on how to adapt it to work best for you.I recommend this book to absolutely ANYONE who would like a new and fresh way of thinking about productivity and how to best accomplish it stress free.  His ideas are easily adaptable too.  I changed some of the methods to fit what works best for me.  Overall, this book is excellent.",This book will give you your life back,"March 4, 2004",5.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEZPOSSCBW3COWZYGDJJ2BPSFR4Q,George F Witte Jr.
"This is a very detailed, serious and logical system to get things done. You may or may not buy the whole system (lists and lists), but implementing some of his advice brings quick results. The alphabetical filing worked very well for me. Dating documents and information was also very valuable. This is simple but it works. I bought it at a time when I took a new job, and it helped me to be more organized and to process the backlog of work. What I discovered is that you still need to find your own organizing style. This guide is quite specific in its advice but you do not have to use the whole system. Just use the ""organizing"" blocks that suit your style. In the end, I am less frustrated with my organizing skills than before and I am going to re-read the book to improve my skills further.","very good book, indeed","January 26, 2004",5.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHDS2EW7QJV4MBDHTMMKPHDIMXYA,XXS
...and I've read a lot! Mr. Allen's ideas and strategies have been implemented by me for the last few years. They do demand effort and committment from you - but then any system worth its salt will do so. (There is no quick-fix). He provides a model (well described by other reviewers here) that can enhance your life immensely and reduce stress. A warning though to perfectionists like myself - don't go overboard when you find out how effective this system is. It's tempting to increase your workload rather than decrease it. And be sure to list social events and other non-work activities as projects too.This little book has been of immense benefit to me.,Best book I've read on organization,"December 14, 2003",5.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF7S25BV2QY6RD7AYN5TARUFJ4WA,Tony Cave
"Finally, I have found a concept that I can apply to everything I do.The Five Phases of Mastering Workflow is great.  It helps me deal with every item that I come into contact with no matter how little or how important.  The Phases:  Collect, Process, Organize, Review, and Do, allow you to not just clean the desk off, but to put things where you can find them, increase your productivity and....yes, even clean out that e-mail box.  I use to have an inbox of 100-150 messages, now everyday that I go home; I have the big 0 in it.  It is amazing how the simple steps that David focuses on can help create a better, more efficient life for me in the office and out of the office.The Natural Planning Model that David Allen created has improved not only my organization, but my productivity.  It incorporates all the things that you have heard from all the business speakers and brings it down to a level that you can apply to your life.  The Planning Model helps you to develop a purpose, determine you successful outcomes, brainstorm, organize, and perhaps the most important part, identify what your next step is so that you can take action; the key to getting anything done.Perhaps the most important thing that I learned from David is the ""Two-Minute Rule,"" if you can do it now in 2 minutes or less, then do it.  If not it will take longer to deal with it later.  This is probably the most important rule when dealing with the overwhelming e-mail inbox.Finally another great action that comes from David is how to clear out your mind from all the clutter in it.  Not exactly something that we think of in terms of organizing.  But David makes a good point that we tend to get a lot different thoughts going around in out head and we get brain overload, or as he likes to put it, our physic ram gets full.  He shows you the path to empty your head.  Trust me; it is a great feeling once you incorporate it into your daily life.This is a great book for the person who is looking for practical application to help you get organized, become more efficient, and better prepared for dealing with anything that life has to throw at you.

"Procrastinate, Stress? Here is a CUREThe title Getting Things Done of this book is a great 'hook'. Many of us would sell our Grannies if we could indeed get things done.A couple of things are mentioned but not spelled out.Getting things on paper and out of your memory hugely reduces both stress and procrastination. The several hundred items that end up as paper files act as an enormous brake on productivity when they are in the subconscious. That is the 'exponential benefit' on productivity mentioned in the book. They can even produce complete stasis, but I digress.In a nutshell Mr. Allen's system is to change (subconscious) mental lists of things to do into a paper filing system. The tasks then are simple physical actions - Move paper to a call list, errand file, discard it, etc. (read the book for the complete list ;-) ). Ask yourself the key question - 'what is the next physical action' with each In-tray item.'If something can be done in less than two minutes do it straight away.' This really got my attention as a friend whose productivity I greatly admire described her own 'two minute rule.'From personal experience this approach is a glorious change. I exaggerate not at all! Remember that we are monkeys. Simple physical tasks are what we have had a million years of practice at.While the book describes a paper system, it explains that once running it can be translated to an organizer or pc. See other reviews re Outlook.There was one snazzy phrase that risked derision - to react with 'Mind like Water' to new tasks. On using Allen's system, I unreservedly withdraw my skepticism. Though artistic, it is an understandable description of the desired approach.Great book! My Granny is only safe because I own and use the book.","Procrastinate, Stress?

"If you are a graduate student like me, a professional, or a homemaker you probably struggle with time management.  The best thing about David Allen's ideas are their simplicity.  By reinforcing the good habits we already have, he moves us to a more productive state.  His methodology works by keeping things simple, almost too simple for my gadget taste.How much time to you spend thinking about what you do?  How much time to you spend planning your work?  I never thought this kind of thinking should be a priority, I just did things.  What this book forces you to do is put all you have to do on paper.  It gets those ""to-do"" lists out of your brain where these lingering thoughts just cause more stress and anxiety.I bought into this philosophy 100% and it changed my attitude and my productivity.  It takes work, but it emphasizes the greatest asset you have, your own mind.  As a productivity junkie since middle school, I have it all:  the paper based planners, the best sellers that implore you to establish rigid priorities and ""habits"", software based on the paper based principle, etc.  The reason nothing worked is that nothing kept up with my own abilities.

"I have had ""get organized"" at the top of my to do list for the last 20 years. I have crept closer to that goal, but my life continues to become more complex and demanding and I may actually be losing ground in the ""becoming organized"" department.I don't think I am stupid or lazy; I did complete post graduate education, but formal education is full of fixed goals you cannot duck or miss. You can also dedicate your whole life and resources to the single goal of graduating. But real life is much more demanding, both professionally and personally.I have read many books on becoming organized and have bought more gadgets, filers, office tools than I can count. As I begin to go through all my files and notes, I am running accross my previous aborted attempts to organize my life.The problem has been that I have never been exposed to a comprehensive system to use all those wonderful tools. All the tools in the world will not help you, until you have the plan and the system that allows you to handle all the ""stuff"" that comes into your life. Most books only list some mechanical methods to organize some of your life, which can help, but for me, they have made little difference.David Allen has finally given me the concepts and system I have been looking for. He is not a scolding nag, but he is adamant about some of the things you must do if you are to be organized and most importantly, to get the things done that you want to do. The book is sympathetic with the plight we all face - too many demands on our precious time. David Allen understands our problems and he offers concrete solutions. He provides the framework and the reader provides the details and the goals. What more could you want?I cannot recommend this book too highly to anyone who really wants to accomplish more with less stress, and is willing to do the work involved. For me, there is no alternative unless I consider moving to a tropical island and ignoring the rest of the world and its demands. Move over Gilligan?I am certainly waiting impatiently for his next book which comes out in September, 2003.

(Know the feeling?)I'm only a few weeks into implementation, and I'll come back and edit this to let you know how it works longterm-- but the ""mind dump"" concept and getting EVERY to-do and should-do and would-like-to-do into a system has done wonders for my mental froth.

"Reviewed by Kathy Burns, Originally published at EBookCritique.com""Getting Things Done"" is a book that teaches you how to do just that: get things done. If you're like most people today, you're busy trying to juggle business, family and personal items all at once, and sometimes a ball (or two) gets dropped.In this book, David Allen provides a complete system to help. The process itself, affectionately referred to as ""GTD"" by loyal followers, is one of the most useful I've personally found.The problem is almost universal: Knowing what you want or have to do in life is one thing, but actually moving forward with it can be a huge challenge. This is especially true for all of us that have never-ending task lists and/or large, long-term projects on our plate. Looking at the mile long task or project list can be overwhelming -- and cause you to simply not do anything at all. In this book, David explains how to break projects, goals and tasks down into single item, doable, actions.Now this is an extremely simplified explanation of the GTD process, but it is comprised of a few key items: The Project List, The Someday/Maybe List, and the Next Actions list. Integrated into these key items is: Inbox, Outbox and File Cabinet management.While all of these components are integral and useful parts of the entire system, the Next Actions list is where the majority of your productivity takes place. In short, a Next Action is the very next thing you need to do in order to move something forward. So instead of looking at a project and wondering how you'll ever be able to handle it, you simply break off a very small chunk -- the very next thing that has to be done -- and focus on that chunk by itself. Once that chunk is completed, you then break off another -- the next thing that has to be done -- and so on.I won't try to explain all of the intricacies -- David did that with over 250 pages in this book -- but I will tell you this: David's system is extremely useful and easy to learn.You can start reaping the rewards of ""Getting Things Done"" before you've even finished the book. I've also found it very handy to keep on the reference shelf for further consultation as I'm refining and customizing my own enhanced productivity system.I am a fan of practical, informative books with examples -- this one really fits the bill and I highly recommend it.","It really does help you ""Get Things Done""","October 3, 2002",5.0,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGNQKY6OGOJVRXFVGQPOM3FFM2CQ,Kathy Burns

I have had general tasks like:  ""do expense account"", on my to do list for weeks.  The right thing for me was: organize receipts from last trip.The author tells you to get rid of the tasks that take under two minutes to complete.  Most of my tasks that take ""two minutes"" or less are not important, and I can sidetrack my self with ""two minute"" projects resulting in a wasted day.  I'm not sure I buy that portion of his program.  I do tend to respond quickly to most simple requests, but there are a lot of those every day.  Some need to be put off in favor of more meaningful projects.I put together the tickler file and inventoried my office, even made a plan for Friday review.  I don't end up looking in my tickler file, as my work is fluid and I can't follow a structured ""to do"" list.  I have a number of projects going, and I re-prioritize all day long.  Friday can be a good day for reflection, or not.  I think the office inventory is very helpful if you've allowed yourself to get backlogged.There is no answer here for reducing your workload.  Which is what all our ""time management"" problems boil down to.  No one really can work 24/7.

"As with most practical advice, the techniques David Allen recommends in ""Getting Things Done"" certainly aren't original. Rather, they serve as useful reminders for those of us who already know how to get organized but have simply forgotten these principles or allowed them to lapse. These types of books operate in much the same way as books on dieting: Most people know how to eat healthy and exercise, but somehow reading a book about it motivates them to put that knowledge into practice. That said, there are several bits of advice in this book that I simply would not have been able to figure out on my own. Judging from the messiness of some of my coworkers' desks and the inefficiency with which they accomplish many of their tasks, I suspect that most people don't know about them, either. Following are the most helpful strategies Allen outlines in his book:1. We all have a vague notion that clutter is not ideal. But because it seems insignificant, many of us allow our desks and our e-mails and our to-do lists and our lives to become cluttered--we know we're busy, and we rationalize the messiness by thinking that we don't have time to organize. But after following the instructions on cleaning your desk (I know this seems basic, but sometimes the most basic processes need guidance), I couldn't believe how liberating it was. Simplicity is so, well, simple that we tend to discount it. But organization is sort of like taking a shower. Once you do it, you can't believe you went for so long without it.2. Don't make your calendar into a plan-to-do list, because you'll train yourself to ignore the tasks that you MUST do that day. Only put on your calendar the things that must get done that day.3. Organize your task list into subjects, and delete the e-mails that do not require any action.4. If you are faced with a long project, determining what the next action step is will help you avoid procrastination.5.

"I attended one of David's seminars in 1986. As a result, I was able to successfully manage 101 concurrent projects, finishing on time and under budget. Fast forward to 2001. I keep this book by my side at all times (David publish it in Ebook form so it's easier to carry!). The company I'm with now wonders how I get the ""impossible"" projects done. Using David's techniques in the book, it seems like I can complete a full work day in fewer hours because I know what all my ""next actions"" are, and do them promptly. Gives me a lot of worry free time.This is a book you ""DO"" not just read. Be prepared to work when you start out, but when the initial work is done, that's when the fun begins.I cleaned my inbox and email box of 300 items in less than 15 minutes, filtering out the junk, the things that needed immediate attention, and the ""someday maybe"" things (like buying my first Harley).This works for my personal life too. No more missed anniversaries, birthdays, phone calls, errands, etc.Do you ever think about work projects at home? Do you ever think about home projects when you're at the office?

"I have tried so many time management systems over ten years and never changed anything. David presented some fresh, innovative ways to approach managing your time, and surprised me.

You must be able to get in the zone. When you apply his techniques, you will always know that you are presently doing exactly the best thing to be doing right now.

"The metaphor of the stress-free mind as a still pond encapsulates the message of David Allen's best-selling book. When a stone is thrown into a pond, Allen points out, the size of the ripples correspond with the size of the stone, and getting the ripples of your mind to correspond with the size of the tasks on your to-do list is the essence of stress-free living. But you don't reach Allen's placid pond via a quiet Zen-like path. Instead, you calm the waters of your mind by building and maintaining a rigid organizational system that's so efficient that you never have to worry about any task once it's been fed into the machine. The popularity of this book probably owes as much to the stress level of the book-buying public as it does to the level of innovation to be found in Allen's organizing machine. The actual time-management techniques offered up by Allen can get lost in fancy jargon and fall short of his general observations about stress, productivity and the mind.

"Anyone who manages multiple projects or a complex individual role will find this book an invaluable help (unless you are already superbly organized). Out of the many books available on time management, priority-setting, and turning plans into action, this is one of the very best. David Allen's system takes some investment of time to implement but then speeds up decision-making and improves clarity of thought by downloading all your free floating concerns into a well-developed framework of files and action lists. This allows you to focus on your current task without worrying about forgetting something and without losing track of materials needed in the future. After explaining his view of mastering workflow and project planning, Allen shows you how to set up for the process and then has you corral all your ""stuff"". You then process this until your in-boxes are empty. He shows clearly how to organize materials for reference and for later action, stresses the importance of regular review, and shows how to keep projects under control. Implementing the whole program requires an investment of time (preferably two full days), though some techniques can be put to use immediately with clear rewards, such as the two-minute rule and the use of special folders for action items that will help you clear your paper and email in-boxes, freeing your mind to focus on current tasks.

"Too many books on getting organized tend to be, well, unorganized. Or worse, impractical. They take digressions through academic theories or offer advice which simply won't work in the real world.Not so with David Allen's ""Getting Things Done."" He offers clear, concise insights on action-oriented steps anyone can implement to make their worklife more productive and stress free. (He recommends the same approach for dealing with your personal life, and while they may work in this context, I'm not sure how many folks really want to run my family like a business).Yes, a lot of Allen's advice is simple common sense and he tends to offer lists which simply added pages instead of help. Nonetheless, he presents obvious insights in useful context by showing how they've worked with his clients and it's simple to skip the unnecessary lists. The key is (and this is why I awarded five stars instead of four) Allen's advice is aimed at folks who live in the real world. You can actually implement what he talks about and see results.While the book may not change your life, it will certainly help you keep it organized and focused.

"David Allen is one of those synthetic (no, not artificial but putting things together) geniuses who seem to arise every now and then to remind us how wonderful we could be if only we did a little more and how easy it is to do it. Well, it's not quite easy because it requires attention (a rare and expensive commodity), but boy does it pay off!! What this book does is tell you (simply and clearly)how to take control of the effort and attention that you normally spread out over time and tasks.  It then shows you how to use your time in a way that guarantees that you will get (much) more done with (much) less effort and will sya goodbye forever to those loose ends of undone and barely-remembered tasks that gnaw away at the edge of consciousness. The system set forth in this book is elegantly simple and, if you are willing to discipline yourself enough to do it, foolproof. When I discovered David Allen a few years ago, the simplicity, elegance, and deep truth of his teaching stunned me.  Applying it to my life was even more of a shock.  It showed how shallow and fragile the (many) other time management systems I had applied were by comparison. If you are ready to take control of your life and build it to a higher level of efficiency and ease, this is an indispensable tool. If you read it carefully and act on it, you will be amazed at what you accomplish and how easy those accomplishments are.

"This book is for all those who are overwhelmed with too many things to do, too little time to do them, and a general sense of unease that something important is being missed.Everyone has experienced times when everything seemed effortless, and progress limitless.  David Allen has captured ways for you to achieve that wonderful state of mind and consciousness more often.His key concept is that every task,  promise, or assignment has a place and a time.  With everything in its proper place and time, you feel in control and replace the time spent on vague worrying with effective, timely action.  As a result, the accomplishments grow while the pressure to accomplish decreases.  As a result, the book contains many insights into ""how to have more energy, be more relaxed, and get a lot more accomplished with much less effort.""The key psychological insight of this book is that rapid progress occurs when you take large, unformed tasks, and break them down and organize them into smaller, sequential steps for exactly what to do and when.  The book provides lots of guidance and examples for how to do this.The book is organized into three sections.  The first gives you an overview of the whole process for how to get more done in a relaxed way.  The second spells out the details of how to implement that process, in a way that a personal coach might use.  The third provides subtle insights that help you appreciate the benefits that follow from using the process.  Like all good coaches, Mr. Allen understands that appreciating a subject from several perspectives and getting lots of practice with it are critical steps in learning.The process advocated by this book is described with lots of systems flow charts that will appeal to all of the engineers and left-brained people.  The right-brained people will find lots of discussions about emotions, feelings, and stress.  So both types of thinkers should do well with this material.The essence of the process is that you write down a note about everything when you take on a new responsibility, make a new commitment, or have a useful thought.  All of this ends up in some kind of ""in"" box.  You then go through your ""in"" box and decide what needs to be done next for each item.  For simple issues, this includes identifying the action you should take first and when to take it.  For tougher issues, you schedule an appropriate time to work the problem in more detail.  You organize the results of this thinking, and review your options for what you should be doing weekly.  Then you take what you choose to do, and act.  Think of this process as the following five steps:  (1) collect (2) process (3) organize (4) decide (5) act.For the tougher problems, you start with identifying your purpose and principles so you know why you care how it all turns out.  Then you imagine the potential good outcomes that you would like.  Following that, you brainstorm with others the best way to get those outcomes.  Then you organize the best pathway.  Finally, you identify the first actions you need to take.  Then you act, as in step 5 above.From this outline, I hope that you can see that this is not rocket science.  It is simple common sense, but with discipline.  The critical part is the discipline because that is what focuses your attention where it will do the most good.  For example, rather than sitting on something you have no idea how to get started, you can decide right away to get ideas from others on what the purpose and principles are that should be used in selecting a solution.  So, you are in motion, and you have saved much time and anxiety.What I learned from this book is that many people allow a lot of time to pass without taking any useful steps because they cannot imagine what to do next.  This process should usually overcome that problem by showing you what to work on, providing methods to accomplish that step in the process, and guiding you to places where you can get appropriate help.  As a result, this book should help overcome the bureaucracy and communications stalls that bedevil most organizations.This fits from my own experience in helping people solve problems.  If you simplify the questions and make them into familiar ones, everyone soon finds powerful alternatives drawn from a lifetime of experiences and memories.  Keep things broad, abstract, and vague, and peoples' eyes glaze over while they struggle for a place to begin.After you have finished reading and applying this book, I suggest that you share your new learning with those you see around you who are the most stressed out.  By helping them gain relaxed control of their activities, you will also be able to enjoy the benefits of their increased effectiveness in supporting your own efforts.May you always get the tools you need, understand what to do next, and move swiftly through timely actions!",Flow from Angst to Action . . . and Relax!,"January 15, 2001",HALL OF FAME,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGGMPD44SNATT4SXIMXWAQBXJJPQ,Donald Mitchell

"OK, first I have to admit I picked up the book at a local Border's where I had a copy on reserve. Having said that... I think I've tried every 'system' for organizing yourself out there. In the 80's it was Day-Timer and Day-Runner. Good calenders and address books, but not much else. 90's was Covey, and Franklin planning. Now we have 'roles and goals' which helps with long term planning but both systems were very inflexible when it came to planning your day to day stuff. I can remember Covey wanting me to plan out my entire week in advance. Nice in theory, but nowhere near reality for those of us whose jobs tend to be more 'crisis-oriented'. I've also tried Agenda, Ecco, Outlook, etc. but its hard to lug around your PC or laptop all the time. About two years ago I came across David Allen's tape seminar and I have to say its the best system I've ever found for organizing 'all' of your life. I can't say it's changed my life (I still have the same job, wife and kids and I still procrastinate too much <g>) but its certainly made all the difference in me being finally, actually organized on day-to-day basis. I'm now the only one in my office with a clean desk :)The book covers just about the same material that I learned in the tape series. The tapes have more anecdotes and 'real-life' examples in them, but the book has a few new pearls and tricks that tells me David's been refining and polishing this system since the tape series.Two last quick points: first, it requires no special binders or refills. You could use a cheap spiral notebook if you want. Personally, I use a palmpilot, which works well. Second, (IMHO) the Weekly Review is the cornerstone of making this system work, and its worked for me for two years.
